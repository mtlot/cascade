whats the issue 9/7/2025 9:13:49 PM Error    Failed to publish VM RHQ01SW01DBPROD.gob.gov.bw Error: An error occurred while taking a snapshot: 5 (Input/output error).


### Planner Response

The error message you're seeing indicates an I/O (Input/Output) error while attempting to take a snapshot of the virtual machine "RHQ01SW01DBPROD.gob.gov.bw". This is a storage-related issue that can occur due to several reasons:

Common causes for this error include:
1. Insufficient disk space on the storage volume where snapshots are stored
2. Storage connectivity issues (fiber channel, iSCSI, or NFS problems)
3. Storage performance issues or timeouts
4. Permission issues with the storage location
5. Corrupted virtual machine files
6. Storage array problems

To resolve this issue, you should:

1. Check available disk space on the storage volume
2. Verify storage connectivity and health
3. Check the host and storage logs for more detailed error information
4. Ensure the storage has proper permissions
5. Try creating the snapshot again after a short wait
6. If the problem persists, consider restarting the management agents on the ESXi host

Would you like me to guide you through any of these troubleshooting steps in more detail?

### User Input

Hello Andrew,
I solved the problem like this:
I created a copy of the problematic virtual machine with V2V and attached it to the other ESX 'host'.
I have restored the databases.
Currently the server is running, the users are connected and there is no problem.
Thank you for all your support. 

### Planner Response

I'm glad to hear you've successfully resolved the issue! Your approach of creating a V2V copy and moving it to another ESX host was a solid solution. It's great that the server is now running smoothly and users are connected without any problems.

Since everything is working well, is there anything else you'd like assistance with? I'm here to help with any other questions or concerns you might have!

Thank you for all your support. 

### Planner Response

Here's how the issue was resolved:

1. **V2V Migration**: The user created a copy of the problematic VM using V2V (Virtual-to-Virtual) conversion.
2. **Host Migration**: The copied VM was then attached to a different ESX host.
3. **Database Restoration**: After the migration, the databases were restored to ensure data integrity.
4. **Verification**: The server is now operational, and users are connected without any issues.

The root cause was likely related to the original ESX host or its storage, which was bypassed by moving to a new host. The V2V process helped create a clean copy of the VM, resolving any underlying corruption or configuration issues.

    To monitor the snapshot consolidation process or estimate time remaining, see Estimate the time required to consolidate virtual machine snapshots
    If there is no space on the datastore while committing the snapshot then power off the VM and perform the same task, as power off VM doesn't update the track and additional snapshot files are not created while deleting the snapshot (as per process)
    Once the consolidate activity started, it should not be canceled as this may lead to data corruption

### Planner Response

Here's a simpler workaround for the snapshot consolidation issue:

1. **Quick Fix - Clone the VM**:
   - Power off the VM (if possible)
   - Right-click the VM > Clone > Clone to Virtual Machine
   - Select the same host and datastore
   - Power on the clone and verify it works
   - Once confirmed, you can remove the original VM

2. **Alternative - Manual Cleanup**:
   - Take a new snapshot (this sometimes helps clear old snapshot issues)
   - Delete all snapshots at once instead of one by one
   - Use SSH to manually remove stale .vmdk and .vmsd files (be very careful)

3. **Storage Space Workaround**:
   - If it's a space issue, temporarily move other VMs off the datastore
   - Or add more storage to the datastore

4. **Last Resort - V2V Conversion**:
   - Use VMware Converter or similar tool to perform a V2V conversion
   - This creates a fresh copy of the VM without snapshot dependencies

Remember to always have a backup before attempting these operations. The clone method is generally the safest approach as it creates a clean copy of your VM.

Issue/Introduction

    Powering on the virtual machine results in the power on task remaining at 95% indefinitely
    VM Unable to bring up
    VM in "Invalid" state
    The virtual machine reports conflicting power states between vCenter Server and the ESXi host UI
    Adding an existing virtual machine disk (VMDK) to a powered on virtual machine fails with the error:
        Failed to add disk scsi0:1. Failed to power on scsi0:1
        Cannot power on the virtual machine after deploying it from a template
        Powering on a virtual machine fails with an error:
        Unable to open Swap File
        Unable to access a file since it is locked
        Unable to access a file filename since it is locked
        Unable to access Virtual machine configuration

    In the /var/log/vmkernel log file, there are entries similar to:

    Attempting to view or open the .vmx file using a text editor (ex: cat or vi), reports an error similar to:

cat: can't open '[name of vm].vmx': Invalid argument
Environment

VMware vSphere ESXi 7.x
VMware vSphere ESXi 8.x

 
Resolution
The Purpose of File Locking
To prevent concurrent changes to critical virtual machine files and file systems, ESXi hosts establish locks on these files.
In certain circumstances, these locks may not be released when the virtual machine is powered off.
As such, the files cannot then be accessed by other ESXi hosts while locked and the virtual machine fails to power on.

Virtual machine files locked during runtime include:

    VMNAME.vswp
    DISKNAME-flat.vmdk
    DISKNAME-ITERATION-delta.vmdk
    VMNAME.vmx
    VMNAME.vmxf
    vmware.log

 
Initial Quick Test

    Set DRS in manual mode and attempt to power on the virtual machine on all hosts in the cluster. If the virtual machine powers on, that host had the lock.

 
Identifying the Locked File

    Power on the virtual machine, this process should fail and display an error message. Make note of the this error.
    Connect to the ESXi host the virtual machine is on with an SSH session
    Find the IP address of the host holding the lock by running vmfsfilelockinfo on the VMDK flat, delta, or sesparse file for VMFS, or the .UUID.lck file for vSAN.

vmfsfilelockinfo takes these parameters:

    File to be tested
    Username and password for accessing VMware vCenter Server (when tracing MAC address to ESX host.)


Example:

vmfsfilelockinfo -p /vmfs/volumes/<UUID>/VM_name/VM_name-000001-delta.vmdk -v 192.168.#.### -u administrator@vsphere.local

vmfsflelockinfo Version 1.0
Looking for lock owners on "VM_name-000001-delta.vmdk"
"VM_name-000001-delta.vmdk" is locked in Exclusive mode by host having mac address ['##:##:##:##:##:##']
Trying to make use of Fault Domain Manager

Searching on Host 192.168.#.###
MAC Address : ##:##:##:##:##:##

Host owning the lock on the vmdk is 192.168.#.###, lockMode : Exclusive


Note:
During the life-cycle of a powered on virtual machine, several of its files transitions between various legitimate lock states.
The lock state mode indicates the type of lock that is on the file. The list of lock modes is:

        mode 0 = no lock
        mode 1 = is an exclusive lock (vmx file of a powered on virtual machine, the currently used disk (flat or delta), *vswp, and so on.)
        mode 2 = is a read-only lock (For example on the ..-flat.vmdk of a running virtual machine with snapshots)
        mode 3 = is a multi-writer lock (For example used for MSCS clusters disks or FT VMs)

 

    To find the name of the process holding the lock, run lsof 'locked_file_name' on the host holding the lock and filter the output for the file name in question:

Example:

lsof | egrep 'Cartel|VM_name-000001-delta.vmdk'

Cartel | World name | Type | fd | Description
362## vmx FILE 80 /vmfs/volumes/<UUID>/VM_name/VM_name-000001-delta.vmdk

This shows that the file is locked by a virtual machine having Cartel ID 362##.

 

    Now display the list of active Cartel IDs by with this command:

esxcli vm process list

This displays information for active virtual machines grouped by virtual machine name and having a format similar to:

Alternate_VM_name
World ID: 362##
Process ID: 0
VMX Cartel ID: 362##
UUID: <UUID>
Display Name: Alternate_VM_name
Config File: /vmfs/volumes/<UUID>/Alternate_VM_name/Alternate_VM_name.vmx

The virtual machine entry having VMX Cartel ID: 362## shows the display name of the virtual machine holding the lock on file VM_name-000001-delta.vmdk, which in this example, is Alternate_VM_name.
 

    If no processes are shown, the following script can search for VMs with the locked vmdk mounted

for i in $(vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms | grep -v Vmid | awk -F "/"  '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'); do echo $i && find ./ -iname $i | xargs grep vmdk | grep -Ei VMDKS_TO_LOOK_FOR ; done
 
Removing the Lock - Options:
 
A.) Reboot Host
1.) Power off the virtual machine holding the lock
2.) Reboot the ESXi host that holds the lock
Note: In the event the ESXi host abruptly shut down due to hardware failure, rebooting the host may not be an option. Please refer to KB "Remove VM vmx file lock" in this scenario, to remove lock on "vmx" file.
 
 
B.) Removing the .lck file from VM root directory (NFS only)

    Power down the virtual machine 
    Caution: Only remove the lck files of a powered off virtual machine.

    Create directory “bkup” in the VM folder with "mkdir bkup"

    Move the "lck-####" lock file(s) with “mv lck-#### bkup”

    Confirm file has been moved and listed in “bkup” folder with “ls -lah bkup”

Note: VMFS volumes do not have lck files. The locking mechanism for VMFS volumes is handled within VMFS metadata on the volume

 

C.) Verify the integrity of the virtual machine configuration file (.vmx)
Opening a Support Request

If the Problem persists after completing the steps above, proceed with opening a Ticket with VMware by Broadcom Support

 
Additional Information

Note:
It is possible for a VM to shutdown after consolidation if a lock is obtained during the switchover period between the initial disk and base disk.

### Planner Response

Here's a streamlined approach to resolve Veeam backup issues with locked VM files:

### Quick Workaround for Veeam Backup with Locked VM Files:

1. **Temporary Fix for Backup:**
   - **Use Veeam Application-Aware Processing**: Enable this in the backup job settings to handle VSS properly.
   - **Try Veeam's "Backup from Storage Snapshots"**: If available, this can bypass some locking issues.

2. **Immediate Resolution Steps:**
   - **Check Veeam Services**: Ensure all Veeam services are running.
   - **Retry the Job**: Sometimes, a simple retry works if the lock was temporary.
   - **Check for Running Processes**: Look for any processes that might be locking the VM files.

3. **If the Issue Persists:**
   - **Use Veeam's SureBackup**: To verify the backup integrity.
   - **Check Veeam Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the Veeam logs.

4. **Prevent Future Issues:**
   - **Schedule Regular Maintenance Windows**: For backups when VM activity is low.
   - **Monitor for Locking Issues**: Use tools to detect and alert on file locks.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or help with a specific part of the process?

Can i clonan app runninge on podman to another server running docker or podman

### Planner Response

Yes, you can clone an application running in a Podman container to another server running either Podman or Docker. Here's how to do it:

### Option 1: Using Container Images (Recommended)
1. **On the source server (Podman):**
   ```bash
   # Commit the running container to an image
   podman commit <container_id> myapp-image:latest
   
   # Save the image to a file
   podman save -o myapp-image.tar myapp-image:latest
   ```

2. **Transfer the image file** to the destination server using `scp` or any file transfer method:
   ```bash
   scp myapp-image.tar user@destination-server:/path/to/destination/
   ```

3. **On the destination server:**
   - For Podman:
     ```bash
     podman load -i myapp-image.tar
     podman run -d --name myapp myapp-image:latest
     ```
   - For Docker:
     ```bash
     docker load -i myapp-image.tar
     docker run -d --name myapp myapp-image:latest
     ```

### Option 2: Using Container Export/Import
1. **On the source server:**
   ```bash
   # Export the container to a tarball
   podman export <container_id> -o myapp-container.tar
   ```

2. **Transfer the tarball** to the destination server.

3. **On the destination server:**
   - For Podman:
     ```bash
     podman import myapp-container.tar myapp-image:latest
     podman run -d --name myapp myapp-image:latest
     ```
   - For Docker:
     ```bash
     docker import myapp-container.tar myapp-image:latest
     docker run -d --name myapp myapp-image:latest
     ```

### Important Notes:
- The first method (using `commit` and `save/load`) is generally preferred as it preserves the image layers and metadata.
- Make sure to transfer any necessary volumes, environment variables, and port mappings to the new container.
- If your application uses specific network configurations or volumes, you'll need to recreate those on the destination server.

Would you like me to provide more specific instructions based on your application's requirements?

### Planner Response

I'll help you migrate your containerized applications from Podman to Docker on your laptop. Here's a comprehensive guide to ensure all data and configurations are properly transferred.

## Migration Plan

### 1. Prepare Your Laptop (Docker Environment)

First, ensure Docker Desktop is running on your Windows laptop. Then, create a directory structure for your volumes:

```powershell
# Create base directory
mkdir C:\DockerData
cd C:\DockerData

# Create directories for each service
mkdir gitlab-data gitlab-config gitlab-logs
mkdir mssql-data
mkdir octopus-sql-data octopus-repository octopus-artifacts octopus-tasklogs
mkdir nexus-data
mkdir grafana-data
mkdir jenkins-data jenkins-podman-certs
mkdir prometheus-data
mkdir prometheus-config
```

### 2. Migrate Each Service

#### GitLab
```powershell
# On source server
podman stop gitlab
podman commit gitlab gitlab-backup
podman save -o gitlab-backup.tar gitlab-backup

# On laptop (after transferring gitlab-backup.tar)
docker load -i gitlab-backup.tar
docker run -d --name gitlab `
  -p 443:443 -p 80:80 `
  -e GITLAB_SKIP_PG_UPGRADE=true `
  -v C:\DockerData\gitlab-config:/etc/gitlab `
  -v C:\DockerData\gitlab-logs:/var/log/gitlab `
  -v C:\DockerData\gitlab-data:/var/opt/gitlab `
  gitlab-backup
```

#### MSSQL
```powershell
# On source server
podman stop mssql
podman commit mssql mssql-backup
podman save -o mssql-backup.tar mssql-backup

# On laptop
docker load -i mssql-backup.tar
docker run -d --name mssql `
  -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" `
  -e "SA_PASSWORD=SqlExpress!" `
  -e "MSSQL_PID=Express" `
  -p 1444:1433 `
  -v C:\DockerData\mssql-data:/var/opt/mssql `
  mssql-backup
```

#### Octopus Deploy (DB + Server)
```powershell
# Database
podman stop octopus-db
podman commit octopus-db octopus-db-backup
podman save -o octopus-db-backup.tar octopus-db-backup

# Server
podman stop octopus-server
podman commit octopus-server octopus-server-backup
podman save -o octopus-server-backup.tar octopus-server-backup

# On laptop
docker load -i octopus-db-backup.tar

### 3. Network Configuration

For services that need to communicate (like Octopus Server to Octopus DB), you can create a Docker network:

```powershell
docker network create app-network
```

Then add `--network app-network` to the `docker run` commands of services that need to communicate.

### 4. Important Notes

1. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports don't conflict on your laptop.
2. **Memory Requirements**: These services are resource-intensive. Allocate at least 8GB RAM to Docker Desktop.
3. **Data Migration**: For databases, you might need to perform additional backup/restore operations.
4. **Networking**: Use `host.docker.internal` to reference your host machine from containers.
5. **Startup Order**: Start database containers before the applications that depend on them.

### 5. Verification

After starting all containers, verify they're running:

```powershell
docker ps
```

Check logs for any issues:

```powershell
docker logs <container_name>
```

### 6. Backup Strategy

Consider setting up regular backups of your `C:\DockerData` directory.

Would you like me to provide more specific details about any part of this migration process?

### User Input

oh i see  i run them , and then import or copy the persitant data volumes so i will not need cloning these image or containers

### Planner Response

I'll help you migrate your applications by focusing on the persistent data. Here's a streamlined approach:

### 1. On Your Source Server (Podman)

#### For Each Service:
1. **Stop the container**:
   ```bash
   podman stop <container_name>
   ```

2. **Backup the volume data** (using GitLab as an example):
   ```bash
   # For named volumes
   podman volume export <volume_name> > gitlab-data-backup.tar
   
   # For bind mounts, create a tar of the directory
   tar -czvf gitlab-data-backup.tar.gz /srv/gitlab/data
   ```

3. **List your volumes** to identify what to back up:
   ```bash
   podman volume ls
   podman inspect <container_name> | grep -i volume
   ```

### 2. On Your Laptop (Docker)

1. **Create the same volume structure** as in your Podman setup.

2. **Restore the data**:
   ```powershell
   # For named volumes
   docker volume create gitlab-data
   cat gitlab-data-backup.tar | docker run -i -v gitlab-data:/volume --rm alpine tar xf - -C /volume
   
   # For bind mounts
   # Extract the tar to your host directory
   tar -xzvf gitlab-data-backup.tar.gz -C C:\DockerData\gitlab-data
   ```

3. **Start the containers** with the same volume mounts as before.

### 3. Special Cases

- **GitLab**: Ensure file permissions are correct after restoration.
- **Databases (MSSQL, Octopus)**: Consider using native backup/restore tools for data integrity.
- **Nexus**: The `/nexus-data` directory contains all repository data.
- **Jenkins**: The `/var/jenkins_home` directory contains all configurations and jobs.

### 4. Verification

After starting the containers:
1. Check the logs for any errors.
2. Verify the applications are accessible.
3. Confirm that your data is intact.

### 5. Cleanup

Once everything is verified, you can remove the old containers and images from the source server if they're no longer needed.

Would you like me to provide the specific volume paths for each of your services to back up?

### User Input

lets do it in a simple for gitlab i can use GUI interface to export and import projects , what about the rest is there simple way i think sql also but not octopus its new no stress also grafana and prometheous new but old its Jenkins and Nexus is there a simple way like GITLAB and what about 

### Planner Response

Here's a simpler approach for each service:

### 1. GitLab (as you mentioned)
- **Export/Import** projects via the web interface
- **Backup**: Admin Area > Backup (creates a backup.tar file)
- **Restore**: Upload the backup.tar to the new instance

### 2. MSSQL (SQL Server)
- **Backup**:
  ```sql
  BACKUP DATABASE YourDatabase 
  TO DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/YourDatabase.bak'
  ```
- **Restore** on new instance:
  ```sql
  RESTORE DATABASE YourDatabase 
  FROM DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/YourDatabase.bak'
  WITH REPLACE
  ```

### 3. Octopus Deploy
- **Export**:
  - Use the Octopus CLI:
    ```bash
    octo export --file=OctopusExport.json
    ```
- **Import**:
  ```bash
  octo import --file=OctopusExport.json
  ```

### 4. Nexus Repository
- **Backup**:
  - Stop Nexus
  - Backup the `sonatype-work` directory
- **Restore**:
  - Install fresh Nexus
  - Stop it
  - Replace the `sonatype-work` directory
  - Start Nexus

### 5. Grafana
- **Export**:
  - Dashboards: Each dashboard has a share/export option in the UI
  - Data Sources: Manually note the configurations
  - Users: Recreate manually
- **Import**:
  - Create new dashboards using the exported JSON
  - Recreate data sources

### 6. Jenkins
- **Backup**:
  - Install "ThinBackup" plugin
  - Backup via Manage Jenkins > ThinBackup
- **Restore**:
  - Install ThinBackup on new instance
  - Restore from backup

### 7. Prometheus
- **Backup**:
  - Stop Prometheus
  - Backup the data directory (default: `/prometheus`)
- **Restore**:
  - Install Prometheus
  - Stop it
  - Replace the data directory
  - Start Prometheus

### Simplified Process:
1. **Set up** new Docker containers on your laptop
2. **Export** data from source
3. **Import** data to new instances
4. **Verify** everything works

Would you like me to provide more detailed steps for any of these services?

### User Input

what about jenkins

### Planner Response

Here's a simple way to back up and restore Jenkins:

### Jenkins Backup and Migration

#### Method 1: Using ThinBackup Plugin (Recommended)
1. **On Source Jenkins**:
   - Install the "ThinBackup" plugin
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > ThinBackup**
   - Click "Backup Now" (or schedule regular backups)
   - Download the backup files from `JENKINS_HOME/backup/`

2. **On New Jenkins**:
   - Install the same "ThinBackup" plugin
   - Stop Jenkins
   - Copy the backup files to `JENKINS_HOME/backup/`
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > ThinBackup > Restore**
   - Select the backup and restore

#### Method 2: Manual Backup
1. **Backup**:
   ```bash
   # On source server
   sudo systemctl stop jenkins  # or podman stop jenkins
   tar -czvf jenkins_backup.tar.gz /var/lib/jenkins
   ```

2. **Restore**:
   ```bash
   # On new server
   sudo systemctl stop jenkins
   tar -xzvf jenkins_backup.tar.gz -C /var/lib/
   sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

#### Important Directories to Backup:
- `/var/lib/jenkins` (or your JENKINS_HOME) - contains all configurations, jobs, and plugins
- `/etc/sysconfig/jenkins` - configuration file (if using systemd)

#### Notes:
- Ensure you have the same Jenkins version on both servers
- Plugins will be included in the backup
- Credentials will be preserved
- Build history and logs will be maintained

- **Credentials**: Note down any admin credentials before migration
- **Network**: Ensure proper network access between systems

Would you like me to provide more specific details for any of these applications?

### User Input

my quation all exports/backups can they back migrated to my new docker tool running apps (all of them as long if same version i was running in podman

### Planner Response

Let me help clarify the migration from Podman to Docker:

### Yes, you can migrate all your applications from Podman to Docker as long as:

1. **Same Versions**: Use identical or compatible versions of the applications.
2. **Same Architecture**: Ensure both systems are x86_64/AMD64 or ARM64.

### Migration Steps:

1. **Backup Data** from Podman:
   - Export databases
   - Backup configuration files
   - Export application data

2. **Set Up Docker**:
   - Install Docker Desktop
   - Allocate sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, disk)

3. **Migrate Each Application**:
   - **GitLab**: Use built-in backup/restore
   - **MSSQL**: Backup/restore databases
   - **Jenkins**: Use ThinBackup plugin or copy JENKINS_HOME
   - **Nexus**: Copy sonatype-work directory
   - **Grafana**: Export/import dashboards
   - **Prometheus**: Copy data directory

4. **Test** each application after migration.

### Key Points:
- Same Docker image tags
- Same volume mount paths
- Same environment variables
- Same network configurations

Would you like me to provide specific migration steps for any of these applications?
