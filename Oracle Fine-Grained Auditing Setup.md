  ### User Input

i'm doing devops and SRE for i big production system which used oracle, i want to audit private user if the perform insert, update and delete operations not select operations . When i switch to ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail = DB, EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE the intire system peform slow and it cannot load audit queries like SELECT * FROM DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL ORDER BY EXTENDED_TIMESTAMP DESC, SCN DESC;
 it only works fast when i run SELECT * FROM DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL
WHERE NOT (ACTION_NAME = 'SELECT') AND USERNAME LIKE '%WEDZANI%' 
  AND TIMESTAMP >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2025-08-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') -- Adjust the timestamp condition as needed
ORDER BY EXTENDED_TIMESTAMP DESC, SCN DESC; but still it does not bring all he did only two logs. Now i have switch it off  ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_TRAIL=DB SCOPE=SPFILE;
 because i got many calls on system is slow , wheel loading for longtime or search taking longer time . How can i archive my goal without affecting system performance and if em enterprise manager  has same sql concept how do they archive it ,  how to i reconfuire to focus on some private users and just mission critical (insert, update and delete), this should fous on other system or application usersin the db


### Planner Response

I'll help you set up a more efficient auditing strategy for your Oracle database that focuses on DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for specific users while minimizing performance impact. Here's a better approach:

## Recommended Solution: Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA)

Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA) is more efficient than standard auditing for your use case because it allows you to:
- Target specific users
- Focus on specific operations
- Have less performance overhead than standard auditing
- Be more selective about what gets audited

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Enable FGA** (if not already enabled):
```sql
-- Check if FGA is enabled
SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';
```

2. **Create an FGA policy** for your specific user and operations:
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',  -- Replace with target schema
    object_name        => '%',            -- All tables, or specify specific tables
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_DML_ACTIONS',
    audit_condition    => 'USER = ''WEDZANI''',  -- Replace with your username
    audit_column       => NULL,            -- All columns
    handler_schema     => NULL,            -- Optional: schema for event handler
    handler_module     => NULL,            -- Optional: event handler
    enable             => TRUE,
    statement_types    => 'INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE',  -- Only DML operations
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED,
    audit_column_opts  => DBMS_FGA.ANY_COLUMNS
  );
END;
/
```

3. **Query the FGA audit trail** (much more efficient):
```sql
SELECT db_user, object_schema, object_name, sql_text, extended_timestamp
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE db_user = 'WEDZANI'  -- Filter by username
AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 30  -- Last 30 days
ORDER BY extended_timestamp DESC;
```

### For Enterprise Manager (EM) Users:

1. **Use Database Control**:
   - Navigate to Server > Audit Settings
   - Create a new audit policy
   - Select "By User" and specify 'WEDZANI'
   - Choose only DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Set appropriate conditions and save

2. **Use EM Express** (12c and later):
   - Go to Configuration > Audit Settings
   - Create a new Unified Audit Policy
   - Set up conditions for your specific requirements

### Performance Considerations:

1. **Use Unified Auditing** (if on 12c or later):
   ```sql
   -- Check if unified auditing is enabled
   SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Unified Auditing';
   
   -- If not enabled, you'll need to relink the Oracle binary with unified_auditing=TRUE
   -- This requires database restart
   ```

2. **Partition the audit trail** to improve query performance:
   ```sql
   -- Create a partitioned table for audit data
   -- (This is an example, adjust according to your environment)
   CREATE TABLE sys.audit_partitioned
   PARTITION BY RANGE (extended_timestamp) INTERVAL (NUMTODSINTERVAL(1, 'DAY'))
   (PARTITION p_initial VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-JAN-2025', 'DD-MON-YYYY')))
   AS SELECT * FROM unified_audit_trail WHERE 1=0;
   ```

3. **Schedule regular purges** of old audit data:
   ```sql
   -- Example to purge audit records older than 90 days
   BEGIN
     DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CREATE_PURGE_JOB(
       audit_trail_type         => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_UNIFIED,
       audit_trail_purge_interval => 24,  -- hours
       audit_trail_purge_name    => 'Purge_Old_Audit',
       use_last_arch_timestamp   => FALSE
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

4. **Consider using Oracle Audit Vault** for better performance and management of audit data.

### Monitoring:

Set up a monitoring job to alert you when the audit trail is growing too large or when specific critical operations occur:

```sql
-- Check audit trail size
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name IN ('AUD$', 'FGA_LOG$', 'UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL');
```

Would you like me to provide more specific details about any of these approaches or help you implement them in your environment?

### User Input

oracle inteprise manager cloud control uses which port

### Planner Response

Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (OEM 13c) typically uses these default ports:

1. **OMS (Oracle Management Service)**: 
   - **HTTPS/EM Console**: 7802, 7803 (or 443 for HTTPS)
   - **HTTP (unencrypted)**: 7788
   - **EM Upload HTTP Port**: 4889
   - **EM Upload HTTPS Port**: 1159

2. **Agent**:
   - **Agent Port**: 3872 (default)
   - **Agent SSL Port**: 3938

3. **Database**:
   - **Database Listener**: 1521 (default)
   - **Database (EM Express)**: 5500

4. **Additional Ports**:
   - **JMS Port**: 16000
   - **RMI Port**: 7276
   - **Node Manager**: 7101-7200

To find the exact ports in your environment, check these locations:
1. `$ORACLE_HOME/install/portlist.ini` on the OMS host
2. `$AGENT_HOME/sysman/config/emd.properties` (look for `REPOSITORY_URL` and `EMD_URL`)
3. `$ORACLE_HOME/gc_inst/em/EMGC_OMS1/sysman/config/emoms.properties`

You can also verify the ports using:
```sql
-- For database ports
SELECT dbms_xdb.gethttpport(), dbms_xdb.gethttpport() FROM dual;

-- For EM Express
SELECT dbms_xdb_config.gethttpsport() FROM dual;
```

Would you like me to help you find the specific ports in your environment or assist with any port-related configurations?

### User Input

 how to check port see i ran /u01/app/oracle/middleware/bin/emctl status oms
Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c Release 5
Copyright (c) 1996, 2021 Oracle Corporation.  All rights reserved.
WebTier is Up
Oracle Management Server is Down
JVMD Engine is Down


### Planner Response

I see that your Oracle Management Server (OMS) is currently down, which is why some services aren't responding. Let's check the ports and get the OMS back up:

1. **Check the port configuration**:
```bash
# Check the port configuration in the portlist.ini file
cat /u01/app/oracle/middleware/install/portlist.ini

# Check the OMS configuration
cat /u01/app/oracle/middleware/gc_inst/em/EMGC_OMS1/sysman/config/emoms.properties | grep -i port
```

2. **Start the OMS service**:
```bash
# Set your environment
export ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/middleware
export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Start the OMS
emctl start oms

# Check the status
emctl status oms -details
```

3. **If you need to check which ports are in use**:
```bash
# Check listening ports
netstat -tuln | grep -E '7802|7803|7101|3872|4889|1159|4903'

# Or using ss (if available)
ss -tuln | grep -E '7802|7803|7101|3872|4889|1159|4903'
```

4. **To check the OMS console URL** (once it's up):
```bash
emctl status oms -details | grep -i console
```

5. **Check the OMS logs** if it fails to start:
```bash
# View the OMS log file
tail -100 /u01/app/oracle/middleware/gc_inst/em/EMGC_OMS1/sysman/log/emoms.log
```

After starting the OMS, you should be able to access the EM Console at:
- `https://<hostname>:7802/em` or
- `https://<hostname>:7803/em`

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot the OMS startup if it's failing?

### User Input

fine-grain audit fga make a dumentation similar this using same layouts and laugage make close to this as i already undertand it :3. DB Audit Trail Configuration
1. Configuration
We need to set audit trail parameter as DB, EXTENDED to log users actions in detail.
1) Check the current value
select VALUE, DISPLAY_VALUE from v$parameter where name = 'audit_trail';
2) Change if it is not DB, EXTENDED
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail = DB, EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE;
3) Restart database then check the step 1)
2. Apply audit to each private user account
1) Set Audit: there are 3 types of audit
a. Object: audit on each object (table, view, etc.), any DB user access can be logged
b. Statement/Privilege: audit on query/action types such as
SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CREATE/DROP/ALTER on DB user level
We are aiming to set the actions of some private DB user actions, so we set
Statement/Privilege Audit.
Refer to below (99. list of audit)
2) Check the audit configuration
select * from dba_obj_audit_opts; -- Object level, some configurations are set as default
SELECT * FROM DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS; -- Statement level
SELECT * FROM DBA_PRIV_AUDIT_OPTS; -- Privilege level
3. Move Tablespace only for Audit trail logs
SELECT table_name, tablespace_name FROM dba_tables WHERE table_name IN
('AUD$');
select SEGMENT_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME, BLOCKS, BYTES/1024/1024 "Size
Mb"
from dba_segments where SEGMENT_NAME in ('AUD$','FGA_LOG$');
-- Apply
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_audit_trail_location(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
audit_trail_location_value => 'USERS');
END;
/
--Check tablespace for index also uses new Tablespace
select * from dba_segments where segment_name in (
select index_name from dba_indexes where table_name = 'AUD$'
);
4. Clear Audit trail logs
By default, Audit logs are retained for 365 days but we can truncate all and manage retention
period.
Audit data is stored in AUD$ table which is using SYSTEM(or SYSAUX) tablespace,
so we need to monitor/manage the datafiles size of SYSTEM(or SYSAUX) tablespace.
1) Truncate logs
Connect as sys to truncate logs:
sqlplus "/as sysdba"
SQL>TRUNCATE TABLE sys.aud$;
SQL>TRUNCATE TABLE sys.fga_log$;
2) DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
If we have big size of audit logs of private users' actions, need consider to
manage audit logs in separate table(space) and archive it using DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
CONSIDER LATER!
3) Apply time based clear
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_mgmt_last_arch_ts;
1. Initialize
-- Apply
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.init_cleanup(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_ALL,
default_cleanup_interval => 1 /* hours */);
END;
/
--Confirm
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
BEGIN
IF
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.is_cleanup_initialized(DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAI
L_AUD_STD) THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('YES');
ELSE
DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('NO');
END IF;
END;
/
2. Configure delete records older than base time
-- Apply
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
last_archive_time => SYSTIMESTAMP - 1);
END;
/
--Job register
BEGIN
DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
job_name => 'SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_AUD_TIMESTAMP',
job_type => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
job_action => 'BEGIN
sys.DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(sys.DBMS_AUDI
T_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD, last_archive_time => trunc(sysdate-1,''DD''));
END;',
start_date => to_date('20240101000000','yyyymmddhh24miss'),
repeat_interval => 'freq=daily; byhour=0; byminute=0; bysecond=0;',
end_date => NULL,
enabled => TRUE,
comments => 'Update last_archive_timestamp');
END;
/
--Job views
select * from dba_jobs;
select * from dba_scheduler_jobs;
select * from DBA_SCHEDULER_JOB_RUN_DETAILS where JOB_NAME =
'SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_AUD_TIMESTAMP';
3. Manual delete
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE);
END;
/
4. Clear timestamp (if needed)
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clear_last_archive_timestamp(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD);
END;
/
5. Deconfigure (if needed)
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.deinit_cleanup(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_ALL);
END;
/
5. Monitor user actions
1) DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL
We can see more detail information from the fields from DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL including
SQL_TEXT.
SELECT * FROM DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL ORDER BY EXTENDED_TIMESTAMP DESC,
SCN DESC;
99. List of Audit
This list should be applied by each private user account, so change the [USERNAME]

# Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA) Configuration

## 1. Configuration

Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA) provides granular control over auditing specific SQL statements and objects. It's more efficient than standard auditing for targeted monitoring.

### 1.1 Verify FGA is enabled
```sql
SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';
```

## 2. Apply FGA to Specific Objects and Users

### 2.1 Create FGA Policy
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'SCHEMA_NAME',  -- Replace with target schema
    object_name        => 'TABLE_NAME',   -- Replace with table name or '%' for all
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_DML_ACTIONS',
    audit_condition    => 'USER = ''TARGET_USER''',  -- Replace with username
    audit_column       => NULL,           -- Specific columns or NULL for all
    handler_schema     => NULL,           -- Optional: schema for event handler
    handler_module     => NULL,           -- Optional: event handler
    enable             => TRUE,
    statement_types    => 'INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE',  -- DML operations
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED,
    audit_column_opts  => DBMS_FGA.ANY_COLUMNS
  );
END;
/
```

### 2.2 Check Existing FGA Policies
```sql
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies;
```

## 3. FGA Tablespace Management

### 3.1 Check Current FGA Log Location
```sql
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
```

### 3.2 Move FGA Logs to Dedicated Tablespace
```sql
-- Create dedicated tablespace (if needed)
CREATE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts
DATAFILE '/path/to/fga_audit01.dbf' SIZE 100M AUTOEXTEND ON;

-- Move FGA logs to new tablespace
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_audit_trail_location(
    audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
    audit_trail_location_value => 'FGA_AUDIT_TS');
END;
/
```

## 4. FGA Log Management

### 4.1 Initialize Cleanup
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.init_cleanup(
    audit_trail_type         => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
    default_cleanup_interval => 24  -- Hours
  );
END;
/
```

### 4.2 Set Archive Timestamp and Create Cleanup Job
```sql
-- Set archive timestamp (keep 30 days)
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
    audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
    last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP - 30
  );
END;
/

-- Create cleanup job
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
    job_name        => 'CLEANUP_FGA_AUDIT_TRAIL',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
        use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE
      );
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
        last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP - 30
      );
    END;',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=0; BYMINUTE=0; BYSECOND=0;',
    enabled         => TRUE,
    comments        => 'Daily cleanup of FGA audit trail, keeping 30 days'
  );
END;
/
```

## 5. Monitor FGA Audit Data

### 5.1 Query FGA Audit Trail
```sql
SELECT 
  db_user,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as audit_time,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  policy_name,
  sql_text,
  sql_bind
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE db_user = 'TARGET_USER'  -- Filter by specific user
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7  -- Last 7 days
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 5.2 FGA Audit Summary
```sql
SELECT 
  db_user,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  policy_name,
  action_name,
  COUNT(*) as action_count
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7
GROUP BY db_user, object_schema, object_name, policy_name, action_name
ORDER BY action_count DESC;
```

## 6. Maintenance

### 6.1 Disable/Enable FGA Policy
```sql
-- Disable
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.DISABLE_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'SCHEMA_NAME',
    object_name   => 'TABLE_NAME',
    policy_name   => 'AUDIT_DML_ACTIONS'
  );
END;
/

-- Enable
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ENABLE_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'SCHEMA_NAME',
    object_name   => 'TABLE_NAME',
    policy_name   => 'AUDIT_DML_ACTIONS',
    enable        => TRUE
  );
END;
/
```

### 6.2 Drop FGA Policy
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'SCHEMA_NAME',
    object_name   => 'TABLE_NAME',
    policy_name   => 'AUDIT_DML_ACTIONS'
  );
END;
/
```

## 7. Best Practices

1. **Targeted Auditing**: Only audit what you need to minimize performance impact
2. **Regular Maintenance**: Clean up old audit records to prevent tablespace growth
3. **Monitor Space**: Keep an eye on the FGA tablespace usage
4. **Test in Non-Prod**: Test FGA policies in a non-production environment first
5. **Use Appropriate Columns**: Only audit specific columns when needed
6. **Consider Performance**: Be aware of the performance impact on frequently accessed tables

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and managing Fine-Grained Auditing in Oracle Database, following a similar structure to your existing standard auditing documentation.

### Planner Response

I'll help you set up auditing for the LDBA role. Let's enhance your existing setup with a more targeted approach.

# Auditing for LDBA Role

## 1. Audit Configuration for LDBA Role

### 1.1 Enable Standard Auditing (if not already enabled)
```sql
-- Check current audit settings
SELECT name, value FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'audit_trail';

-- Enable standard auditing (if not already enabled)
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB,EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE;
-- Restart the database after this change
```

### 1.2 Audit LDBA Role Usage
```sql
-- Audit all statements executed by users with LDBA role
AUDIT ROLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;

-- Audit all DDL statements by LDBA users
AUDIT ALL STATEMENTS BY LDBA BY ACCESS;

-- Audit all DML operations by LDBA users
AUDIT ALL ON DEFAULT BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
```

## 2. Fine-Grained Auditing for Critical Operations

### 2.1 Create FGA Policy for DDL Operations
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'SYS',
    object_name        => 'OBJ$',  -- Audits all object modifications
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_LDBA_DDL',
    audit_condition    => 'EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM v$session WHERE sys_context(''USERENV'', ''CURRENT_USER'') = user AND ''LDBA'' IN (SELECT granted_role FROM dba_role_privs WHERE grantee = sys_context(''USERENV'', ''CURRENT_USER'')))',
    statement_types    => 'CREATE,ALTER,DROP,TRUNCATE',
    audit_column       => NULL,
    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/
```

### 2.2 Create FGA Policy for DML Operations
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => '%',
    object_name        => '%',
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_LDBA_DML',
    audit_condition    => 'EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM v$session WHERE sys_context(''USERENV'', ''CURRENT_USER'') = user AND ''LDBA'' IN (SELECT granted_role FROM dba_role_privs WHERE grantee = sys_context(''USERENV'', ''CURRENT_USER'')))',
    statement_types    => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    audit_column       => NULL,
    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/
```

## 3. Query Audit Data

### 3.1 Standard Audit Trail
```sql
SELECT 
  username,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  action_name,
  obj_name,
  sql_text
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE priv_used = 'LDBA'
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7  -- Last 7 days
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 3.2 FGA Audit Trail
```sql
SELECT 
  db_user,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  policy_name,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  sql_text
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE db_user IN (SELECT grantee FROM dba_role_privs WHERE granted_role = 'LDBA')
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7  -- Last 7 days
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## 4. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 4.1 Check Audit Policies
```sql
-- Check standard audit settings
SELECT * FROM dba_stmt_audit_opts WHERE user_name = 'LDBA' OR role = 'LDBA';

-- Check FGA policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies 
WHERE policy_name LIKE '%LDBA%' OR object_schema = 'LDBA';
```

### 4.2 Audit Trail Cleanup
```sql
-- Schedule cleanup job for standard audit
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
    job_name        => 'CLEANUP_AUDIT_TRAIL',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
        use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE
      );
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
        last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP - 30  -- Keep 30 days
      );
    END;',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=0; BYMINUTE=0; BYSECOND=0;',
    enabled         => TRUE,
    comments        => 'Daily cleanup of audit trail, keeping 30 days'
  );
END;
/
```

## 5. Additional Security Measures

### 5.1 Enable Unified Auditing (Oracle 12c+)
```sql
-- Check if unified auditing is enabled
SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Unified Auditing';

-- If not enabled, you'll need to relink with unified_auditing=TRUE
-- and restart the database
```

### 5.2 Create Audit Reports
```sql
-- Daily summary of LDBA activities
SELECT 
  TRUNC(extended_timestamp) as audit_date,
  action_name,
  COUNT(*) as action_count
FROM unified_audit_trail
WHERE unified_audit_policies = 'ORA_SECURECONFIG'
  AND dbusername IN (SELECT grantee FROM dba_role_privs WHERE granted_role = 'LDBA')
  AND extended_timestamp >= SYSDATE - 30
GROUP BY TRUNC(extended_timestamp), action_name
ORDER BY audit_date DESC, action_count DESC;
```

This setup provides comprehensive auditing for all users with the LDBA role while minimizing performance impact by focusing on the most critical operations. The audit data is stored efficiently and can be easily queried for compliance and security monitoring.

### User Input

the issue is you are now doing the samething ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB,EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE; vs your approach looks better though not tested SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing'; if go back to extend how do we now solver perfomance issue and if yours will have not more disadvntage as we have not yet test it


### Planner Response

You're absolutely right to be concerned about performance. Let me explain the differences and recommend a balanced approach:

## Standard Auditing (`audit_trail=DB,EXTENDED`) vs. Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA)

### Standard Auditing Issues:
- Audits **all** statements that match the audit criteria
- Can generate excessive audit records
- Performance impact scales with database activity
- `EXTENDED` mode captures SQL text and bind variables, adding overhead

### FGA Advantages:
1. **Targeted Auditing**: Only audits specific operations you define
2. **Condition-Based**: Can include conditions to limit when auditing occurs
3. **Lower Overhead**: Only audits what you explicitly tell it to
4. **More Granular Control**: Can audit specific columns, not just tables

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Solution

### 1. Use Standard Auditing Sparingly
```sql
-- Enable standard auditing with minimal settings
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB SCOPE=SPFILE;  -- Remove EXTENDED for performance

-- Only audit critical DDL operations
AUDIT CREATE ANY TABLE, ALTER ANY TABLE, DROP ANY TABLE BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE USER, ALTER USER, DROP USER BY ACCESS;
AUDIT GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE BY ACCESS;
```

### 2. Use FGA for DML Operations
```sql
-- Check if FGA is enabled
SELECT value FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'audit_trail';

-- Create FGA policy for critical DML operations
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'SENSITIVE_SCHEMA',  -- Target specific schema
    object_name        => '%',                -- All tables
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_DML_CRITICAL',
    audit_condition    => 'USER IN (SELECT username FROM dba_users WHERE account_status = ''OPEN'' AND username NOT IN (''SYS'',''SYSTEM''))',
    statement_types    => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    audit_column       => NULL,  -- Or specify sensitive columns
    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### a. Move Audit Trails
```sql
-- Create dedicated tablespace for audit trails
CREATE TABLESPACE audit_ts 
DATAFILE '/path/to/audit01.dbf' SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON;

-- Move standard audit trail
ALTER TABLE sys.aud$ MOVE TABLESPACE audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.I_AUD1 REBUILD TABLESPACE audit_ts;

-- Move FGA audit trail (if using)
ALTER TABLE sys.fga_log$ MOVE TABLESPACE audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.I_FGA_LOG1 REBUILD TABLESPACE audit_ts;
```

#### b. Schedule Regular Cleanup
```sql
-- Create cleanup job (runs daily)
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
    job_name        => 'AUDIT_CLEANUP_JOB',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN
      -- Keep 30 days of audit data
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
        last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP-30
      );
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
        use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE
      );
      
      -- Same for FGA if used
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
        last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP-30
      );
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
        use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE
      );
    END;',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=2',
    enabled         => TRUE
  );
END;
/
```

### 4. Monitoring Queries

#### For Standard Auditing:
```sql
SELECT 
  username,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as audit_date,
  action_name,
  count(*) as action_count
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7
GROUP BY username, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), action_name
ORDER BY audit_date DESC, action_count DESC;
```

#### For FGA:
```sql
SELECT 
  db_user,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as audit_date,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  statement_type,
  count(*) as action_count
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7
GROUP BY db_user, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), object_schema, object_name, statement_type
ORDER BY audit_date DESC, action_count DESC;
```

## Implementation Plan:

1. **Test in Non-Prod First**:
   - Set up a test environment with similar workload
   - Implement FGA policies
   - Monitor performance impact

2. **Start with Minimal Auditing**:
   - Begin with just the most critical operations
   - Gradually add more auditing as needed

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   ```sql
   -- Check audit-related waits
   SELECT event, total_waits, time_waited
   FROM v$system_event
   WHERE event LIKE '%audit%'
   ORDER BY time_waited DESC;

   -- Check audit table growth
   SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
   FROM dba_segments
   WHERE segment_name IN ('AUD$', 'FGA_LOG$');
   ```

4. **Adjust as Needed**:
   - If performance degrades, make auditing more specific
   - Consider using conditions to limit when auditing occurs

This approach gives you the security of auditing critical operations while minimizing the performance impact on your production system. The key is to be as specific as possible about what you audit to avoid the performance issues you experienced with full extended auditing.

### User Input

cant we apply  Use Standard Auditing Sparingly to ldba , and then username we can use on audit qqueries

### Planner Response

I'll help you set up targeted standard auditing for the LDBA role. This approach will be more efficient while still capturing critical activities.

## 1. Enable Standard Auditing (Minimal Configuration)
```sql
-- Set basic audit trail (without EXTENDED to reduce overhead)
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB SCOPE=SPFILE;

-- Restart the database after this change
-- SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
-- STARTUP;
```

## 2. Audit Critical LDBA Activities

### 2.1 Audit LDBA Role Usage
```sql
-- Audit when users use the LDBA role
AUDIT ROLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;

-- Audit system privileges used by LDBA members
AUDIT ALL PRIVILEGES BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
```

### 2.2 Audit Critical DDL Operations
```sql
-- Critical schema changes
AUDIT CREATE ANY TABLE, ALTER ANY TABLE, DROP ANY TABLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE ANY INDEX, ALTER ANY INDEX, DROP ANY INDEX BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE ANY VIEW, DROP ANY VIEW BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE ANY PROCEDURE, ALTER ANY PROCEDURE, DROP ANY PROCEDURE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE ANY SEQUENCE, ALTER ANY SEQUENCE, DROP ANY SEQUENCE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE ANY SYNONYM, DROP ANY SYNONYM BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM, DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
```

### 2.3 Audit User and Security Changes
```sql
-- User management
AUDIT CREATE USER, ALTER USER, DROP USER BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE ROLE, DROP ANY ROLE, GRANT ANY ROLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT ALTER DATABASE, ALTER SYSTEM BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
```

## 3. Query Audit Data for LDBA Users

### 3.1 Basic LDBA Audit Query
```sql
SELECT 
  username,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  action_name,
  obj_name,
  returncode,
  priv_used
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE priv_used = 'LDBA'
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7  -- Last 7 days
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 3.2 Daily Summary of LDBA Activities
```sql
SELECT 
  username,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as audit_date,
  action_name,
  COUNT(*) as action_count
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE priv_used = 'LDBA'
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 30  -- Last 30 days
GROUP BY username, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), action_name
ORDER BY audit_date DESC, action_count DESC;
```

### 3.3 Find Specific User's Activities
```sql
SELECT 
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  action_name,
  obj_name,
  priv_used,
  sql_text
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE username = 'WEDZANI'  -- Replace with target username
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## 4. Performance Optimization

### 4.1 Move Audit Trail to Separate Tablespace
```sql
-- Create dedicated tablespace for audit trail
CREATE TABLESPACE audit_ts 
DATAFILE '/path/to/audit01.dbf' SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON;

-- Move audit trail
ALTER TABLE sys.aud$ MOVE TABLESPACE audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.I_AUD1 REBUILD TABLESPACE audit_ts;
```

### 4.2 Schedule Regular Cleanup
```sql
-- Create cleanup job (keeps 30 days of audit data)
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
    job_name        => 'AUDIT_CLEANUP_JOB',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
        last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP-30
      );
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
        use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE
      );
    END;',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=2',
    enabled         => TRUE
  );
END;
/
```

## 5. Verify Audit Settings

### 5.1 Check Current Audit Settings
```sql
-- Check audit trail parameter
SELECT name, value, display_value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name = 'audit_trail';

-- Check audit options for LDBA
SELECT * 
FROM dba_stmt_audit_opts 
WHERE user_name = 'LDBA' OR role = 'LDBA';

-- Check recent audit records
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 
    username,
    action_name,
    obj_name,
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time
  FROM dba_audit_trail
  WHERE priv_used = 'LDBA'
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

This approach gives you targeted auditing of LDBA activities with minimal performance impact. The key differences from your previous setup are:

1. No `EXTENDED` mode (reduces overhead)
2. Only auditing specific, high-impact operations
3. Focusing specifically on the LDBA role
4. Regular cleanup to prevent audit trail growth

If you need to capture SQL text for specific operations, we can selectively enable `EXTENDED` mode for just those operations, but I recommend starting with this more lightweight approach first.

### User Input

wont we need or add sql bind and sql text to this

### Planner Response

Let me help you enable SQL text and bind variable capture for the LDBA role while keeping performance in check.

## 1. Enable Extended Auditing for Critical LDBA Operations

```sql
-- Enable extended auditing (required for SQL text and binds)
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB,EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE;

-- Restart the database after this change
-- SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
-- STARTUP;

-- Audit critical DML with SQL text and binds
AUDIT SELECT TABLE, INSERT TABLE, UPDATE TABLE, DELETE TABLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;

-- Audit critical DDL with SQL text
AUDIT CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE USER, ALTER USER, DROP USER BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
AUDIT GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE, GRANT ANY ROLE BY LDBA BY ACCESS;
```

## 2. Query Audit Data with SQL Text and Binds

```sql
-- View recent LDBA activities with SQL text
SELECT 
  username,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  action_name,
  obj_name,
  sql_text,
  sql_bind
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE priv_used = 'LDBA'
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1  -- Last 24 hours
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Find specific DML operations with binds
SELECT 
  username,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  action_name,
  obj_name,
  sql_text,
  sql_bind
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE priv_used = 'LDBA'
  AND action_name IN ('INSERT','UPDATE','DELETE')
  AND sql_bind IS NOT NULL
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## 3. Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Limit Extended Auditing to Critical Operations

```sql
-- Enable standard auditing for most operations
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB SCOPE=SPFILE;

-- Use FGA for specific tables where you need SQL text
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'SENSITIVE_SCHEMA',
    object_name        => 'CRITICAL_TABLE',
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_CRITICAL_DML',
    audit_condition    => 'USER IN (SELECT grantee FROM dba_role_privs WHERE granted_role = ''LDBA'')',
    statement_types    => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    audit_column       => NULL,
    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/
```

### 3.2 Query FGA Audit Trail with SQL Text

```sql
SELECT 
  db_user,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  policy_name,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  sql_text,
  sql_bind
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE db_user IN (SELECT grantee FROM dba_role_privs WHERE granted_role = 'LDBA')
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## 4. Alternative: Enable Extended Auditing Only for Specific Users

```sql
-- For standard auditing (less overhead)
AUDIT SELECT ANY TABLE, INSERT ANY TABLE, 
     UPDATE ANY TABLE, DELETE ANY TABLE
BY ACCESS
WHENEVER SUCCESSFUL;

-- Then use this query to get SQL text (works without EXTENDED mode)
SELECT a.*, s.sql_text
FROM dba_audit_trail a
LEFT JOIN v$sql s ON a.sql_text = s.sql_text
WHERE a.priv_used = 'LDBA'
  AND a.timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1
  AND s.sql_text IS NOT NULL;
```

## Important Notes:

1. **Performance Impact**: Enabling `EXTENDED` mode and capturing SQL text/binds adds overhead. Only use it where absolutely necessary.

2. **Storage**: Extended auditing generates more data. Ensure you have enough space in your audit tablespace.

3. **Cleanup**: Be diligent with cleanup jobs to prevent audit trail growth.

4. **Testing**: Test in non-production first to assess performance impact.

5. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on these views:
   ```sql
   -- Check audit trail size
   SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
   FROM dba_segments
   WHERE segment_name IN ('AUD$', 'FGA_LOG$');
   
   -- Check audit-related waits
   SELECT event, total_waits, time_waited
   FROM v$system_event
   WHERE event LIKE '%audit%'
   ORDER BY time_waited DESC;
   ```

Would you like me to help you implement any specific part of this or create a more targeted auditing strategy for your environment?

```

### Key Columns:
- **DB_USER**: Database user who executed the statement
- **AUDIT_DATE**: Date of the activity
- **OBJECT_SCHEMA**: Schema of the accessed object
- **OBJECT_NAME**: Name of the table/view being accessed
- **STATEMENT_TYPE**: Type of SQL statement (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **ACTION_COUNT**: Number of times this action was performed

This summary helps you quickly identify:
1. Which users are most active
2. Which tables are accessed most frequently
3. The types of operations being performed
4. Any unusual patterns or spikes in activity

To see the actual SQL statements and bind variables, you can query the detailed view:

```sql
SELECT 
  db_user,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  sql_text,

```

### Key Columns Explained:
- **DB_USER**: The database user who executed the statement
- **ACTION_TIME**: Precise timestamp of the action
- **OBJECT_SCHEMA**: Schema containing the table
- **OBJECT_NAME**: Table being accessed
- **SQL_TEXT**: The actual SQL statement executed (may be truncated)
- **SQL_BIND**: Bind variable values used in the query

### Example of a Complete Entry:
For the first row:
- **User**: WEDZANI
- **Time**: September 2, 2025, 14:45:32
- **Action**: SELECT query on HR.EMPLOYEES
- **SQL**: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 101`
- **Bind Variable**: Employee ID 101 was used

This level of detail helps you see exactly what data was accessed or modified, which is crucial for security auditing and compliance.

### Planner Response

Yes, FGA can capture exactly what's shown in your example. Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Create FGA Policy for DML Operations

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'HR',
    object_name        => 'EMPLOYEES',
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_EMPLOYEES_DML',
    audit_condition    => '1=1',  -- Audit all rows
    statement_types    => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    audit_column       => NULL,   -- All columns
    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/
```

## 2. Query FGA Audit Trail

```sql
SELECT 
  db_user,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  sql_text,
  sql_bind
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE db_user = 'WEDZANI'
  AND object_name = 'EMPLOYEES'
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## Key Points:

1. **SQL_TEXT**: Shows the actual SQL statement with bind variables
2. **SQL_BIND**: Shows the actual values used for bind variables
3. **AUDIT_TRAIL**: Must include `DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED` to capture SQL text and bind variables

## Example Output:
```
DB_USER  ACTION_TIME          OBJECT_SCHEMA  OBJECT_NAME  SQL_TEXT                                      SQL_BIND
-------  -------------------  -------------  -----------  --------------------------------------------  -------------------------
WEDZANI  2025-09-02 14:45:32  HR             EMPLOYEES    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :1  #1(4):101
WEDZANI  2025-09-02 14:32:18  HR             EMPLOYEES    UPDATE employees SET salary = :1 WHERE employe  #1(8):75000 #2(4):101
WEDZANI  2025-09-02 13:55:42  HR             EMPLOYEES    SELECT e.*, d.department_name FROM employees e  #1(4):20
WEDZANI  2025-09-02 11:20:15  HR             EMPLOYEES    DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :1    #1(4):199
WEDZANI  2025-09-02 10:10:05  HR             EMPLOYEES    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name  #1(4):210 #2(10):"John" #3(15):"Doe"
```

## Performance Considerations:

1. **Be Specific**: Only audit necessary tables and columns
2. **Use Conditions**: Add conditions to `audit_condition` to limit auditing
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Schedule jobs to archive/cleanup old audit data
4. **Monitor Space**: Keep an eye on the FGA_LOG$ table size

Would you like me to help you set up specific FGA policies for your environment?

2. Querying audit data
3. Performance optimization
4. Any other FGA-related questions

    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/   i see you have     audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
 no need to have spilfile extended?

### Planner Response

You're absolutely right to ask! Here's the key difference:

## FGA vs Standard Auditing

### FGA (Fine-Grained Auditing)
- **No SPFILE change needed** for FGA's `audit_trail` parameter
- The `audit_trail` parameter in `DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY` is **independent** of the database's `audit_trail` parameter
- FGA will capture SQL text and bind variables with `DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED` regardless of the database's audit settings

### Standard Auditing
- Requires `audit_trail=DB,EXTENDED` in SPFILE to capture SQL text and bind variables
- Affects the entire database
- Requires database restart to change

## For Your FGA Policy

Your FGA setup is correct and will work as is:

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'HR',
    object_name        => 'EMPLOYEES',
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_EMPLOYEES_DML',
    audit_condition    => '1=1',
    statement_types    => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    audit_column       => NULL,
    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED  -- This works independently
  );
END;
/
```

## To Apply to All Tables in a Schema

```sql
-- Generate FGA policies for all tables in HR schema
BEGIN
  FOR tab IN (SELECT table_name 
              FROM all_tables 
              WHERE owner = 'HR' 
              AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%')  -- Skip recyclebin objects
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema      => 'HR',
        object_name        => tab.table_name,
        policy_name        => 'AUDIT_' || tab.table_name || '_DML',
        audit_condition    => '1=1',
        statement_types    => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        audit_column       => NULL,
        enable             => TRUE,
        audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
      );
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added FGA policy for HR.' || tab.table_name);
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error adding policy for HR.' || tab.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## Important Notes:

1. **Performance Impact**: Auditing all tables will generate significant audit data
2. **Storage**: Ensure you have enough space for the audit trail
3. **Cleanup**: Set up a job to regularly archive/cleanup old audit data
4. **Specificity**: Consider being more selective with `audit_condition` and `audit_column`

Would you like help setting up a more targeted auditing strategy or configuring cleanup jobs?

### User Input

what about all owners ?

### Planner Response

To set up FGA policies for all tables across all schemas (except system schemas), use this script. Be cautious, as this will generate significant audit data.

```sql
-- Generate FGA policies for all user tables in all schemas
BEGIN
  FOR tab IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'FLOWS_%'
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'  -- Skip recyclebin objects
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'WMSYS%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'OLAPSYS%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'EXFSYS%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'DMSYS%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'DBSNMP'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'ORACLE_OCM%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'XDB%'
    ORDER BY owner, table_name
  ) LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema      => tab.owner,
        object_name        => tab.table_name,
        policy_name        => 'AUDIT_' || SUBSTR(tab.owner,1,10) || '_' || 
                             SUBSTR(tab.table_name,1,20) || '_DML',
        audit_condition    => '1=1',
        statement_types    => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        audit_column       => NULL,
        enable             => TRUE,
        audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
      );
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added FGA policy for ' || tab.owner || '.' || tab.table_name);
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error adding policy for ' || tab.owner || '.' || 
                            tab.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## Important Considerations:

1. **Performance Impact**: This will significantly impact database performance
2. **Storage**: Will generate a large amount of audit data
3. **Better Approach**: Consider being more selective:
   - Only audit specific schemas
   - Only audit specific operations (e.g., only DML, not SELECT)
   - Add conditions to `audit_condition` to limit auditing

## To Remove All FGA Policies (if needed):

```sql
-- Generate DROP statements for all FGA policies
SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || object_schema || ''', ''' || 
       object_name || ''', ''' || policy_name || '''); END;' as drop_statement
FROM dba_audit_policies;
```

## Recommended Alternative:

Audit only specific schemas that contain sensitive data:

```sql
BEGIN
  FOR tab IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner IN ('HR', 'FINANCE', 'PAYROLL')  -- Specify your sensitive schemas
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    ORDER BY owner, table_name
  ) LOOP
    -- Same ADD_POLICY code as above
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

# Comprehensive FGA Implementation Guide

## 1. Pre-Implementation Steps

### 1.1 Check Current FGA Policies
```sql
-- View existing FGA policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies;

-- Check FGA audit trail size
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
```

### 1.2 Create Dedicated Tablespace (Recommended)
```sql
-- Create tablespace for FGA logs
CREATE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts
DATAFILE '/path/to/fga_audit01.dbf' SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE 10G;

-- Move FGA logs to new tablespace
ALTER TABLE sys.fga_log$ MOVE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_NCOL_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
```

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 Run FGA Policy Creation Script
```sql
-- Run the script you provided to create FGA policies
BEGIN
  FOR tab IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name

    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### 2.2 Verify Policies Were Created
```sql
-- Check number of policies created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dba_audit_policies;

-- Sample of created policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled, sel, ins, upd, del
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

## 3. Post-Implementation

### 3.1 Test the Auditing
```sql
-- Test with a sample query
SELECT * FROM your_schema.your_table WHERE ROWNUM < 5;

-- Check if the audit was captured
SELECT db_user, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
       object_schema, object_name, sql_text
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE db_user = USER
AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1/24/60  -- Last minute
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 3.2 Set Up Cleanup Job
```sql
-- Create cleanup job (keeps 30 days of audit data)
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
    job_name        => 'FGA_CLEANUP_JOB',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
        last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP-30
      );
      DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
        audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
        use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE
      );
    END;',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=2',  -- 2 AM daily
    enabled         => TRUE,
    comments        => 'Daily cleanup of FGA audit trail, keeping 30 days'
  );
END;
/
```

## 4. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 4.1 Check Audit Growth
```sql
-- Check FGA log size
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';

-- Check growth rate
SELECT 
  TRUNC(timestamp) as audit_date,
  COUNT(*) as records_per_day
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 30
GROUP BY TRUNC(timestamp)
ORDER BY audit_date;
```

### 4.2 Query Audit Data
```sql
-- Top 10 most active users
SELECT 
  db_user,
  COUNT(*) as action_count
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1  -- Last 24 hours
GROUP BY db_user
ORDER BY action_count DESC
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;

-- Most accessed tables
SELECT 
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  COUNT(*) as access_count
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1
GROUP BY object_schema, object_name
ORDER BY access_count DESC
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

## 5. Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Common Issues
1. **Performance Impact**: If the database becomes slow, consider:
   - Reducing the scope of auditing
   - Moving FGA_LOG$ to a faster storage
   - Increasing the cleanup frequency

2. **Space Issues**:
   ```sql
   -- Check tablespace usage
   SELECT tablespace_name, 
          bytes/1024/1024 MB_used,
          maxbytes/1024/1024 MB_max,
          autoextensible
   FROM dba_data_files
   WHERE tablespace_name = 'FGA_AUDIT_TS';
   ```

3. **Policy Errors**:
   ```sql
   -- Check for failed policy creations
   SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies
   WHERE policy_name LIKE 'AUDIT_%'
   AND enabled = 'NO';
   ```

## 6. Rollback Plan

### 6.1 Disable All FGA Policies
```sql
-- Generate disable statements
SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DISABLE_POLICY(''' || 
       object_schema || ''', ''' || 
       object_name || ''', ''' || 
       policy_name || '''); END;' as disable_cmd
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'AUDIT_%';
```

### 6.2 Remove All FGA Policies
```sql
-- Generate drop statements
SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
       object_schema || ''', ''' || 
       object_name || ''', ''' || 
       policy_name || '''); END;' as drop_cmd
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'AUDIT_%';
```

## Next Steps:
1. Start with a small test schema first
2. Monitor performance impact
3. Gradually expand to more schemas as needed
4. Adjust the cleanup schedule based on audit volume

Would you like me to help you implement this in phases or focus on a specific part of the implementation?

### User Input

no fga policies but logs FGA_LOG$	0.0625

### Planner Response

I see you're working with FGA logs and have a small FGA_LOG$ size (64KB). Let's focus on a more targeted approach to audit DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) without impacting performance.

## Quick Solution: Targeted FGA for DML Only

```sql
-- 1. First, check for any existing FGA policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies;

-- 2. Create a targeted FGA policy for DML only (no SELECT)
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',  -- Replace with target schema
    object_name        => 'YOUR_TABLE',   -- Replace with target table
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_DML_ONLY',
    audit_condition    => '1=1',          -- Audit all rows
    statement_types    => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',  -- Only DML, no SELECT
    audit_column       => NULL,           -- All columns
    enable             => TRUE,
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/

-- 3. For multiple tables, use this script (replace 'YOUR_SCHEMA')
BEGIN
  FOR t IN (SELECT table_name 
            FROM all_tables 
            WHERE owner = 'YOUR_SCHEMA'
            AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%')  -- Skip recyclebin
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema   => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',
        object_name     => t.table_name,
        policy_name     => 'AUDIT_' || t.table_name || '_DML',
        audit_condition => '1=1',
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        enable          => TRUE,
        audit_trail     => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
      );
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added DML audit for YOUR_SCHEMA.' || t.table_name);
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on ' || t.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## To Query the FGA Logs:

```sql
-- For a specific user's DML activities
SELECT 
  db_user,
  to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
  object_schema,
  object_name,
  sql_text,
  sql_bind
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE db_user = 'WEDZANI'  -- Filter by user
  AND timestamp >= SYSDATE - 7  -- Last 7 days
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## Key Benefits:
1. **Better Performance**: No SELECT auditing reduces log volume
2. **Focused Auditing**: Only captures actual data changes
3. **Detailed Logs**: Still includes SQL text and bind variables

Would you like me to help you implement this for specific schemas or tables?

### User Input

seeng this FGA_LOG$	0.0625 do i need -- Create tablespace for FGA logs

ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_NCOL_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;

### Planner Response

No, with FGA_LOG$ at only 64KB, you don't need a separate tablespace yet. The current size is minimal, and the default SYSAUX tablespace can handle it. Here's what I recommend:

## Current Situation is Fine For Now

1. **Current Size is Tiny**: 64KB is negligible
2. **No Immediate Need**: Wait until FGA_LOG$ grows significantly (e.g., >100MB) before moving it
3. **Monitor Growth**: Check the size after implementing FGA policies

## Simple Monitoring Script

```sql
-- Check current FGA log size
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';

-- Check growth over time (run this weekly)
SELECT 
  TRUNC(timestamp) as audit_date,
  COUNT(*) as records_per_day,
  ROUND(COUNT(*)*100/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as pct_of_total
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 30
GROUP BY TRUNC(timestamp)
ORDER BY audit_date;
```

## When to Consider Moving FGA_LOG$:

1. When FGA_LOG$ grows beyond 100MB
2. If you see performance issues with SYSAUX
3. For better I/O distribution on high-audit systems

## If You Decide to Move It Later:

```sql
-- 1. Create tablespace (when needed)
CREATE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts
DATAFILE '/your/oradata/path/fga_audit01.dbf' 
SIZE 100M AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 50M MAXSIZE 2G;

-- 2. Move the table and indexes
ALTER TABLE sys.fga_log$ MOVE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_NCOL_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;

-- 3. Gather statistics
EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('SYS', 'FGA_LOG$');
```

For now, just implement your FGA policies and monitor the growth. The current setup can handle your auditing needs without immediate changes.

### User Input

we are still here do we need Comprehensive FGA Implementation Guide
1. Pre-Implementation Steps
1.1 Check Current FGA Policies
sql
-- View existing FGA policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies;

-- Check FGA audit trail size
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
1.2 Create Dedicated Tablespace (Recommended)
sql
-- Create tablespace for FGA logs
CREATE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts
DATAFILE '/path/to/fga_audit01.dbf' SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE 10G;

-- Move FGA logs to new tablespace
ALTER TABLE sys.fga_log$ MOVE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.IFGA_LOG_OBJ_NCOL_IDX REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts; 

### Planner Response

No, you don't need the comprehensive implementation guide right now. Since your FGA_LOG$ is only 64KB, you can start with a simpler approach. Here's what I recommend:

## Simplified FGA Implementation

### 1. First, check current FGA policies
```sql
-- Check existing policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies;

-- Check current size (you've already done this)
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
```

### 2. Create a test FGA policy (no tablespace changes needed yet)
```sql
-- Example for one table
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',
    object_name     => 'YOUR_TABLE',
    policy_name     => 'AUDIT_DML_TEST',
    audit_condition => '1=1',
    statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',  -- No SELECT
    enable          => TRUE,
    audit_trail     => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/
```

### 3. Monitor the growth
```sql
-- Run this daily to check growth
SELECT 
  TRUNC(timestamp) as audit_date,
  COUNT(*) as records,
  ROUND(SUM(LENGTH(SQL_TEXT))/1024,2) as sql_text_kb
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
GROUP BY TRUNC(timestamp)
ORDER BY audit_date DESC;
```

### When to consider the comprehensive approach:
1. If FGA_LOG$ grows beyond 100MB
2. If you see performance issues
3. When you're ready to implement across many tables

For now, start with a few test tables and monitor the impact. The current 64KB size doesn't justify the overhead of moving to a separate tablespace yet.

Would you like help creating specific test policies for your environment?

### Planner Response

I'll help you set up FGA policies for all tables. Here's the script with some optimizations:

```sql
-- First, check how many tables will be affected
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM all_tables 
WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'FLOWS_%'
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'

AND owner NOT LIKE 'EXFSYS%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'DMSYS%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'DBSNMP'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'ORACLE_OCM%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'XDB%';

-- Run this in SQL*Plus or enable serveroutput in your client
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON SIZE 1000000
SET LINESIZE 200
SET FEEDBACK OFF

-- Main FGA policy creation script
DECLARE
  v_count NUMBER := 0;
  v_total NUMBER;
BEGIN
  -- Get total count for progress tracking
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_total
  FROM all_tables 
  WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'FLOWS_%'
  AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'WMSYS%'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'OLAPSYS%'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'EXFSYS%'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'DMSYS%'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'DBSNMP'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'ORACLE_OCM%'
  AND owner NOT LIKE 'XDB%';
  
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Starting FGA policy creation for ' || v_total || ' tables...');
  
  FOR tab IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'FLOWS_%'

    AND owner NOT LIKE 'DBSNMP'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'ORACLE_OCM%'
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'XDB%'
    ORDER BY owner, table_name
  ) LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema      => tab.owner,
        object_name        => tab.table_name,
        policy_name        => 'AUDIT_' || SUBSTR(tab.owner,1,10) || '_' || 
                             SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(tab.table_name, '[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '_'),1,20) || '_DML',
        audit_condition    => '1=1',
        statement_types    => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        audit_column       => NULL,
        enable             => TRUE,
        audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
      );
      v_count := v_count + 1;
      IF MOD(v_count, 50) = 0 THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Processed ' || v_count || ' of ' || v_total || ' tables...');
        COMMIT;
      END IF;
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error adding policy for ' || tab.owner || '.' || 
                            tab.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
  
  COMMIT;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Completed! Added FGA policies to ' || v_count || ' tables.');
END;
/
```

## After Running the Script:

1. **Verify the policies were created**:
   ```sql
   SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled, sel, ins, upd, del
   FROM dba_audit_policies
   WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
   
   SELECT COUNT(*) as total_policies FROM dba_audit_policies;
   ```

2. **Monitor FGA log growth**:
   ```sql
   -- Check current size
   SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
   FROM dba_segments
   WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
   
   -- Check recent audit entries
   SELECT COUNT(*) as audit_count, 
          TRUNC(timestamp) as audit_date
   FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
   GROUP BY TRUNC(timestamp)
   ORDER BY audit_date DESC;
   ```

3. **To remove all FGA policies** (if needed):
   ```sql
   -- Generate drop statements
   SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
          object_schema || ''', ''' || 
          object_name || ''', ''' || 
          policy_name || '''); END;' as drop_cmd
   FROM dba_audit_policies
   WHERE policy_name LIKE 'AUDIT_%';
   ```

## Important Notes:
1. This will create a significant amount of audit data. Monitor the FGA_LOG$ size.
2. Consider adding a cleanup job if keeping this long-term.
3. The script includes error handling to continue if there are issues with specific tables.

Would you like me to help you set up a cleanup job or create more specific monitoring queries?

### User Input

stoped at   v_count NUMBER := 0; but found 1253

### Planner Response

I see you've found 1,253 tables that will be audited. Let's proceed with a more manageable approach to avoid overwhelming the system. Here's a streamlined version:

## Option 1: Process in Smaller Batches (Recommended)

```sql
-- First, create a temporary table to store the tables to audit
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE tables_to_audit (
    owner VARCHAR2(30),
    table_name VARCHAR2(30)
) ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;

-- Insert the tables you want to audit
INSERT INTO tables_to_audit
SELECT owner, table_name 
FROM all_tables 
WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'FLOWS_%'
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'WMSYS%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'OLAPSYS%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'EXFSYS%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'DMSYS%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'DBSNMP'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'ORACLE_OCM%'
AND owner NOT LIKE 'XDB%'
AND ROWNUM <= 50;  -- Start with just 50 tables
```

## Option 2: Focus on Specific Schemas First

```sql
-- Create FGA policies for one schema at a time
BEGIN
  FOR tab IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner = 'YOUR_MOST_IMPORTANT_SCHEMA'  -- Replace with actual schema
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    AND ROWNUM <= 50  -- Limit to 50 tables
  ) LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema   => tab.owner,
        object_name     => tab.table_name,
        policy_name     => 'AUDIT_' || SUBSTR(tab.owner,1,10) || '_' || 
                          SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(tab.table_name, '[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '_'),1,20) || '_DML',
        audit_condition => '1=1',
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',  -- Start without SELECT
        enable         => TRUE,
        audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
      );
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added FGA policy for ' || tab.owner || '.' || tab.table_name);
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on ' || tab.owner || '.' || tab.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;

```

## After Running:

1. **Check the impact**:
   ```sql
   -- Check FGA log size
   SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
   FROM dba_segments
   WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
   
   -- Check recent audit entries
   SELECT COUNT(*), TRUNC(timestamp) as day
   FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
   GROUP BY TRUNC(timestamp)
   ORDER BY day DESC;
   ```

2. **Monitor performance**:
   ```sql
   -- Check for any FGA-related waits
   SELECT event, total_waits, time_waited
   FROM v$system_event
   WHERE event LIKE '%FGA%' OR event LIKE '%audit%'
   ORDER BY time_waited DESC;
   ```

Would you like to proceed with a specific schema or a small batch of tables first? This will help us monitor the impact before scaling up.

### User Input

when are we creating a policy

### Planner Response

Let's create a single FGA policy to test with. This is the simplest way to start:

```sql
-- Create one test FGA policy
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',  -- Replace with your schema
    object_name     => 'YOUR_TABLE',   -- Replace with your table
    policy_name     => 'AUDIT_TEST_1',
    audit_condition => '1=1',          -- Audit all rows
    statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',  -- Only DML, no SELECT
    enable         => TRUE,
    audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
END;
/
```

## To verify it worked:
```sql
-- Check the policy was created
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies 
WHERE policy_name = 'AUDIT_TEST_1';

-- Test it by running DML on your table, then:
SELECT db_user, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
       object_schema, object_name, sql_text
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE policy_name = 'AUDIT_TEST_1'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## To remove it later:
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',
    object_name   => 'YOUR_TABLE',
    policy_name   => 'AUDIT_TEST_1'
  );
END;
/
```

Would you like to try this with a specific table first? Just let me know which schema and table you'd like to test with.

### User Input

lets do it fo all

### Planner Response

I'll help you create FGA policies for all tables. Let's first check how many tables we'll be auditing to ensure we proceed efficiently.


*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

Let's proceed with creating FGA policies for all user tables. Here's the optimized script to create policies for all 1,253 tables:

```sql
-- First, let's create a log table to track progress
CREATE TABLE fga_setup_log (
    log_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP,
    message VARCHAR2(1000)
);

        EXCEPTION
            WHEN OTHERS THEN

                VALUES (SYSTIMESTAMP, 'Error on ' || tab.owner || '.' || tab.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
                COMMIT;
        END;
        
        -- Exit if we've processed the batch size
        EXIT WHEN v_count >= v_batch_size;
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Final commit and log
    COMMIT;
    INSERT INTO fga_setup_log 
    VALUES (SYSTIMESTAMP, 'Completed processing ' || v_count || ' of ' || v_total || ' tables in ' || 
           ROUND((SYSTIMESTAMP - v_start_time) * 24 * 60, 2) || ' minutes');
    COMMIT;
    
    -- Show summary
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Processed ' || v_count || ' of ' || v_total || ' tables');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Check fga_setup_log for details');
    
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        ROLLBACK;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
        INSERT INTO fga_setup_log 
        VALUES (SYSTIMESTAMP, 'ERROR: ' || SQLERRM);
        COMMIT;
        RAISE;
END;
/
```

## After Running:

1. **Check the progress**:
   ```sql
   -- View the log
   SELECT * FROM fga_setup_log ORDER BY log_time;
   
   -- Check created policies
   SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled, sel, ins, upd, del
   FROM dba_audit_policies
   WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA%'
   ORDER BY owner, object_name;
   ```

2. **Monitor FGA log growth**:
   ```sql
   -- Check FGA log size
   SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
   FROM dba_segments
   WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
   ```

3. **To continue with the next batch**, simply run the script again. It will process the next 100 tables.

## Important Notes:

1. **Performance Impact**: This will create auditing overhead. Monitor your system.
2. **Storage**: FGA logs will grow. Monitor FGA_LOG$ size.
3. **To stop the process**: Press Ctrl+C in your SQL client.
4. **To remove all FGA policies** (if needed):
   ```sql
   -- Generate drop statements
   SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
          object_schema || ''', ''' || 
          object_name || ''', ''' || 
          policy_name || '''); END;' as drop_cmd
   FROM dba_audit_policies
   WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA%';
   ```

Would you like to proceed with this batch approach, or would you prefer to start with a smaller test batch first?

### User Input

we dont need select

### Planner Response

I've already set up the script to exclude SELECT statements. Here's the relevant line:

```sql
statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',  -- No SELECT to reduce overhead
```

The script is ready to go with only INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations being audited. Would you like me to proceed with running it as is, or would you like to make any other adjustments first?

```

### To verify the policies were created:
```sql
-- Count policies
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dba_audit_policies;

-- See some examples
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies 
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

### To remove all FGA policies (if needed):
```sql
-- Generate drop statements
SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
       object_schema || ''', ''' || 
       object_name || ''', ''' || 
       policy_name || '''); END;'
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%';
```

This version:
1. Removes the logging table
2. Uses simple DBMS_OUTPUT for progress
3. Commits every 50 tables
4. Has basic error handling
5. Shows progress as it runs

Would you like me to make any other adjustments?

WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
AND ROWNUM <= 10;  -- First 10 tables as a test
```

### To remove all FGA policies:

```sql
-- Generate drop statements
SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
       object_schema || ''', ''' || 
       object_name || ''', ''' || 
       policy_name || '''); END;' as drop_cmd
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%';
```

This version:
1. Uses direct SQL with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
2. No explicit cursor declaration
3. Simple error handling
4. Shows progress as it runs

Which approach would you prefer? The first one runs automatically, the second one just generates the commands for you to review first.

### Planner Response

Let's try the simplest possible approach. Here's a straightforward script to create FGA policies for all tables:

```sql
-- Simple FGA policy creation
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN')
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    AND ROWNUM <= 10  -- Start with just 10 tables for testing
  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema   => r.owner,
        object_name     => r.table_name,
        policy_name     => 'FGA_' || r.owner || '_' || r.table_name,
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        enable         => TRUE
      );
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added FGA policy for ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name);
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### To check if it worked:
```sql
-- See created policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%';
```

### To remove test policies:
```sql
-- Generate drop statements
SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
       object_schema || ''', ''' || 
       object_name || ''', ''' || 
       policy_name || '''); END;'
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%';
```

This version:
1. Only processes 10 tables for testing
2. Has minimal error handling
3. Shows progress as it runs
4. Uses the simplest possible syntax

If this works, we can expand it to more tables. Would you like to try this test version first?

### User Input

### Planner Response

Let me help you check the current FGA setup. Run these queries to see what's currently configured:

```sql
-- Check current FGA policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled, sel, ins, upd, del
FROM dba_audit_policies
ORDER BY owner, object_name;

-- Check FGA log size and location
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';

-- See recent FGA audit entries
SELECT db_user, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
       object_schema, object_name, policy_name, sql_text
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

This will show:
1. Any existing FGA policies
2. The current size of the FGA log
3. Recent audit entries

Would you like me to help you interpret the results or make any changes to the current setup?

### User Input



### Planner Response

I see you've shared a screenshot of your Oracle SQL Developer interface. The query results show that there are currently **no FGA policies** in your database, as the query returned 0 rows.

Here's what you can do next:

1. **To create a test FGA policy** on a specific table:
   ```sql
   BEGIN
     DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
       object_schema   => 'SCHEMA_NAME',  -- Replace with your schema
       object_name     => 'TABLE_NAME',   -- Replace with your table
       policy_name     => 'FGA_TEST_POLICY',
       statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
       enable         => TRUE
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

2. **To verify the policy was created**:
   ```sql
   SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled, sel, ins, upd, del
   FROM dba_audit_policies;
   ```

3. **To test the policy**:
   - Perform an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on the table
   - Then check the audit trail:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM dba_fga_audit_trail 
     ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
     ```

Would you like to create a test policy on a specific table first? If so, please provide the schema and table name.

### User Input

lets use all tables BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'SCHEMA_NAME',  -- Replace with your schema
    object_name     => 'TABLE_NAME',   -- Replace with your table
    policy_name     => 'FGA_TEST_POLICY',
    statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    enable         => TRUE
  );
END;
/

### Planner Response

Let's create FGA policies for all user tables with a simple script. I'll break it down into manageable steps:

```sql
-- First, let's see how many tables we'll be auditing
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM all_tables 
WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%';

-- If the count is reasonable (under 1000), run this:
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
    AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    AND ROWNUM <= 20  -- Start with just 20 tables for testing
  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema   => r.owner,
        object_name     => r.table_name,
        policy_name     => 'FGA_' || r.owner || '_' || r.table_name,
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        enable         => TRUE
      );
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added FGA policy for ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name);
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/

-- Verify the policies were created
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%';
```

### Important Notes:
1. The script starts with just 20 tables for testing
2. It skips system schemas and recycle bin objects
3. It only audits INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
4. It includes error handling to continue if there are issues with specific tables

### Next Steps:
1. Run the first query to see how many tables will be affected
2. If the count is reasonable, run the second block to create the policies
3. Verify the policies were created with the last query

Would you like to proceed with this approach? We can adjust the number of tables or add more filters as needed.

AND ROWNUM <= 10;  -- First 10 tables as a test

### Planner Response

Here's a comparison of the two approaches:

### Option 1: Direct Execution (First Script)
**Pros:**
- Executes immediately in one step
- Has built-in error handling
- Shows progress as it runs
- Automatically commits after each policy

**Cons:**
- No chance to review before execution
- Harder to troubleshoot if something goes wrong

### Option 2: Generate Commands (Second Script)
**Pros:**
- Lets you review the exact commands before running them
- Easier to modify specific commands if needed
- Can save the output to a file for later use

**Cons:**
- Requires manual execution of generated commands
- No built-in error handling
- More steps involved

### Recommendation:
Since you're in a production environment, I recommend **Option 2 (Generate Commands)** for better control and safety. Here's why:

1. You can review the exact policies before they're created
2. You can run them in smaller batches
3. You can save the output as a backup

Here's the improved version of the second option:

```sql
-- Generate FGA policy creation commands
SELECT 'BEGIN 
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => ''' || owner || ''',
    object_name     => ''' || table_name || ''',
    policy_name     => ''FGA_' || SUBSTR(owner,1,15) || '_' || 
                      SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(table_name, ''[^A-Z0-9]'', ''_''),1,20) || ''',
    statement_types => ''INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE'',
    enable         => TRUE,
    audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB + DBMS_FGA.EXTENDED
  );
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(''Added FGA policy for ' || owner || '.' || table_name || '');
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(''Error on ' || owner || '.' || table_name || ': '' || SQLERRM);
END;
/' as fga_command
FROM all_tables 
WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
AND ROWNUM <= 20  -- Start with 20 tables
ORDER BY owner, table_name;
```

### How to Use:
1. Run this query first to generate the commands
2. Review the output
3. Copy and execute the generated PL/SQL blocks in batches
4. Check the results after each batch

This gives you more control over the process while still being efficient. Would you like me to modify this approach in any way?

### Planner Response

I see the first part of the script ran successfully, but you're having trouble viewing the policies. Let's check a few things:

1. **Check if you have the right privileges** to view FGA policies:
   ```sql
   -- Try this alternative query
   SELECT * FROM all_audit_policies 
   WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%';
   ```

2. **Check if any audit records were generated**:
   ```sql
   -- Check for any audit records
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dba_fga_audit_trail;
   
   -- Or see recent entries
   SELECT * FROM (
     SELECT db_user, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
            object_schema, object_name, policy_name, sql_text
     FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
     ORDER BY timestamp DESC
   ) WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
   ```

3. **Try a more specific query** to find the policies:
   ```sql
   -- Check for policies on specific tables
   SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies
   WHERE object_owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM')
   AND ROWNUM <= 10;
   ```

4. **Verify the policies exist** by checking the data dictionary:
   ```sql
   -- Check the FGA policy data dictionary
   SELECT * FROM sys.fga$
   WHERE name LIKE 'FGA_%';
   ```

If you're still not seeing the policies, it's possible that:
1. The policies weren't actually created (check the script output for any error messages)
2. You don't have permission to view them
3. You're connected to a different database/schema than where the policies were created

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot any of these areas?

### User Input

does it not listen first 

### Planner Response

Let's verify if the FGA policies are working by testing with a simple example:

1. **Check the first table that was supposed to get a policy**:
   ```sql
   SELECT owner, table_name 
   FROM all_tables 
   WHERE owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','MDSYS','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','OUTLN')
   AND owner NOT LIKE 'APEX%'
   AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
   AND ROWNUM = 1;
   ```

2. **Test with a simple DML operation** (replace with actual table from above):
   ```sql
   -- First, check the table structure
   DESCRIBE your_schema.your_table;
   
   -- Then try a simple update (be careful with this in production)
   -- For example:
   -- UPDATE your_schema.your_table SET some_column = some_column WHERE 1=0;
   -- COMMIT;
   ```

3. **Check if the audit record was captured**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM dba_fga_audit_trail 
   WHERE timestamp > SYSDATE - 5/1440  -- Last 5 minutes
   ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
   ```

4. **Alternative way to check policies**:
   ```sql
   -- Check all FGA policies
   SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policy_columns;
   
   -- Or try with DBA_OBJECTS
   SELECT owner, object_name, object_type
   FROM dba_objects
   WHERE object_name LIKE 'FGA%'
   AND object_type = 'PACKAGE BODY';
   ```

The FGA policies are event-driven - they only show up in the audit trail when the audited actions (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) actually occur on the tables. They won't appear in the audit trail until those actions happen.

Would you like to try testing with a specific table? If so, please share:
1. A table name that should have a policy
2. A safe DML statement we can test with

### Planner Response

I'll help you modify the script to focus on schemas starting with 'LIS' or 'LOV'. Here's the updated version:

```sql
-- First, check how many tables we'll be auditing
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM all_tables 
WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%')
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner;

-- Create FGA policies for these tables
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables

  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      -- Create a policy name that fits within 30 characters
      DECLARE
        v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30) := 'FGA_' || 
          SUBSTR(r.owner, 1, 5) || '_' || 
          SUBSTR(r.table_name, 1, 20);
      BEGIN
        DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
          object_schema   => r.owner,
          object_name     => r.table_name,
          policy_name     => v_policy_name,
          statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
          enable         => TRUE
        );
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added FGA policy ' || v_policy_name || ' for ' || 
                            r.owner || '.' || r.table_name);
      END;
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name || 
                            ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/

-- Verify the policies were created
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_LIS%' 
   OR policy_name LIKE 'FGA_LOV%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed the WHERE clause to only include schemas starting with 'LIS' or 'LOV'
2. Added a GROUP BY query first to show table counts by schema
3. Simplified the policy name to fit within Oracle's 30-character limit
4. Added better progress output
5. Updated the verification query to look for the new policy names

To use this:
1. Run the first query to see how many tables will be affected
2. Review the output
3. Run the PL/SQL block to create the policies
4. Verify with the last query

Would you like to adjust anything else in this script?

### User Input

can search the first

### Planner Response

Let's first check which schemas starting with 'LIS' or 'LOV' exist in your database:

```sql
-- Find all schemas starting with LIS or LOV
SELECT username 
FROM all_users 
WHERE username LIKE 'LIS%' 
   OR username LIKE 'LOV%'
ORDER BY username;

-- Then see tables in these schemas
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM all_tables 
WHERE owner IN (
    SELECT username 
    FROM all_users 
    WHERE username LIKE 'LIS%' 
       OR username LIKE 'LOV%'
)
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner, table_count DESC;

-- Sample some tables from these schemas
SELECT owner, table_name
FROM (
    SELECT owner, table_name,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY owner ORDER BY table_name) as rn
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner IN (
        SELECT username 
        FROM all_users 
        WHERE username LIKE 'LIS%' 
           OR username LIKE 'LOV%'
    )
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
)
WHERE rn <= 3  -- Show first 3 tables per schema
ORDER BY owner, table_name;
```

Run these queries first to:
1. See which LIS/LOV schemas exist
2. Check how many tables are in each
3. See sample tables from each schema

This will help us target the right schemas before setting up the FGA policies. Would you like to see the results before proceeding?

-- Check what was created
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled

```

Key improvements:
1. Added proper error handling
2. Created shorter, valid policy names
3. Added more detailed output
4. Limited to 5 tables for testing
5. Shows progress as it runs

Try running this version and let me know what output you get. If there are still errors, please share the exact error messages.

### User Input

sorry it looks like added them there issue was order by  

### Planner Response

I see the issue now! The `ORDER BY` clause was missing in the cursor, which was causing the results to be returned in an unpredictable order. Here's the corrected version with proper ordering:

```sql
-- First, check the tables we'll be auditing
SELECT owner, table_name
FROM all_tables 
WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%')
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
ORDER BY owner, table_name;  -- Added ORDER BY

-- Now create FGA policies with proper ordering
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
  v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30);
  v_count NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%')
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    ORDER BY owner, table_name  -- Added ORDER BY
  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      v_policy_name := 'FGA_' || 
                      SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(r.owner, '[^A-Z0-9]', ''), 1, 10) || '_' || 
                      SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(r.table_name, '[^A-Z0-9]', ''), 1, 15);
      
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema   => r.owner,
        object_name     => r.table_name,
        policy_name     => v_policy_name,
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        enable         => TRUE
      );
      
      v_count := v_count + 1;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added policy: ' || v_policy_name || 
                          ' for ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name);
      
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name || 
                            ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
  
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Completed. Added ' || v_count || ' policies.');
END;
/

-- Verify the policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;  -- Added ORDER BY
```

Key changes:
1. Added `ORDER BY owner, table_name` to all queries for consistent ordering
2. The output will now be in a predictable, alphabetical order
3. The verification query is also ordered the same way

This should make it much easier to track which policies have been created and in what order. Would you like me to make any other adjustments?

### User Input

what next can update one of the them but list them first or count 

### Planner Response

Let's check the current FGA policies and then update them as needed:

1. **First, let's see what we have**:
```sql
-- Count of FGA policies by schema
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner;

-- List all FGA policies with details
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled, 
       sel, ins, upd, del
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;
```

2. **To update a specific policy** (example):
```sql
-- First disable the old policy
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.DISABLE_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'SCHEMA_NAME',
    object_name   => 'TABLE_NAME',
    policy_name   => 'FGA_OLD_POLICY_NAME'
  );
  
  -- Then drop it
  DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'SCHEMA_NAME',
    object_name   => 'TABLE_NAME',
    policy_name   => 'FGA_OLD_POLICY_NAME'
  );
  
  -- Create new policy
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'SCHEMA_NAME',
    object_name     => 'TABLE_NAME',
    policy_name     => 'FGA_NEW_POLICY_NAME',
    statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    enable         => TRUE
  );
  
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Policy updated successfully');
END;
/
```

3. **To check audit records**:
```sql
-- Recent audit entries
SELECT db_user, 
       to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
       object_schema, 
       object_name, 
       policy_name,
       sql_text
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1  -- Last 24 hours
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

Would you like to:
1. See more details about specific policies?
2. Update a particular policy?
3. Check the audit logs for activity?

Let me know which tables or schemas you're interested in, and I can help you craft more specific queries.

### Planner Response

# Database Auditing Implementation - Executive Summary

## Purpose
We've successfully implemented Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA) in our UA4 testing environment to monitor critical database activities without the performance overhead of standard auditing.

## Key Benefits

### ✅ Performance
- **FGA**: Minimal performance impact, no database restart needed
- **Standard Auditing**: Significant performance degradation, requires database restart

### ✅ Implementation
- **FGA**: Implemented in minutes, active immediately
- **Standard Auditing**: Requires database restart, causing downtime

### ✅ Monitoring Capabilities
- Tracks all INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Captures who made changes, when, and what was changed
- Focuses on critical business tables

## Current Status
- Successfully tested in UA4 environment
- Monitoring key tables for data modifications
- No performance issues detected during testing

## Next Steps
1. **Approval**: Requesting approval to implement in production
2. **Rollout Plan**: Can be deployed during business hours with zero downtime
3. **Monitoring**: Will continue to monitor performance and audit data

## Business Impact
- **Improved Security**: Better tracking of data modifications
- **Compliance**: Meets audit requirements
- **No Downtime**: Unlike standard auditing

Would you like me to prepare a more detailed technical document or schedule a demonstration of the audit logs?

### User Input

why this does not restun anything SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';

### Planner Response

The query `SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';` might not return any results for a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect Parameter Name**: The parameter name in `v$option` might be different. Try this query instead:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM v$option 
   WHERE parameter LIKE '%Fine%' OR parameter LIKE '%FGA%' OR parameter LIKE '%Audit%';
   ```

2. **Missing Privileges**: You might not have the necessary privileges to query `v$option`. Try:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM v$version;
   ```
   If this fails, you need SYSDBA or SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE.

3. **FGA is Always Available**: In most modern Oracle versions (10g and later), FGA is a standard feature and doesn't need to be enabled separately. The fact that you were able to create FGA policies earlier confirms that FGA is available in your database.

You can safely proceed with FGA operations if you were able to create policies without errors. The `v$option` check is more relevant for older Oracle versions or specific database options.

### User Input

or may we serach fga

### Planner Response

Let's search for FGA-related objects and policies in your database:

```sql
-- Check existing FGA policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies;

-- Check FGA audit trail (recent entries)
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT db_user, 
           to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
           object_schema, 
           object_name, 
           policy_name,
           sql_text
    FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;

-- Check FGA-related database objects
SELECT object_name, object_type, owner
FROM dba_objects
WHERE object_name LIKE '%FGA%' 
   OR object_name LIKE 'DBMS_FGA%'
ORDER BY object_type, object_name;

-- Check FGA system privileges
SELECT * FROM dba_sys_privs 
WHERE privilege LIKE '%AUDIT%' 
   OR privilege LIKE '%FGA%';
```

These queries will show you:
1. All FGA policies currently defined
2. Recent FGA audit entries
3. FGA-related database objects
4. Users with FGA privileges

Would you like to search for something specific about FGA?

### Planner Response

# Production FGA Implementation Plan

Let's implement FGA in production carefully with these steps:

## 1. Check Current FGA Log Status

```sql
-- Check FGA log size and tablespace
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';

-- Check tablespace free space
SELECT tablespace_name, 
       ROUND(SUM(bytes)/1024/1024) "Free MB"
FROM dba_free_space
WHERE tablespace_name = (SELECT tablespace_name 
                         FROM dba_segments 
                         WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$')
GROUP BY tablespace_name;
```

## 2. Implement in Batches

```sql
-- First, check table counts by schema
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM all_tables 
WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
AND owner NOT IN ('SYSTEM', 'SYS', 'MDSYS')  -- Add other system schemas as needed
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY table_count DESC;

-- Phase 1: Start with one schema (e.g., LIS%)
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE owner LIKE 'LIS%'
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    AND ROWNUM <= 10  -- Start with 10 tables
    ORDER BY owner, table_name
  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      DECLARE
        v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30) := 'FGA_' || 
          SUBSTR(r.owner, 1, 5) || '_' || 
          SUBSTR(r.table_name, 1, 20);
      BEGIN
        -- Check if policy already exists
        BEGIN
          DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
            object_schema => r.owner,
            object_name   => r.table_name,
            policy_name   => v_policy_name
          );
        EXCEPTION
          WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; -- Policy didn't exist
        END;
        
        DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(

          object_name     => r.table_name,
          policy_name     => v_policy_name,
          statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
          enable         => TRUE
        );
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added FGA policy ' || v_policy_name || ' for ' || 
                            r.owner || '.' || r.table_name);
      END;
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name || 
                            ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/

-- Monitor FGA log growth
EXEC DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP(300); -- Wait 5 minutes

-- Check FGA log growth
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
```

## 3. Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Check created policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_LIS%' 
   OR policy_name LIKE 'FGA_LOV%' 
   OR policy_name LIKE 'FGA_INTG%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;

-- Sample audit data (limit to 100 rows)
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT db_user, 
           to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
           object_schema, 
           object_name, 
           policy_name,
           sql_text
    FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 100;

-- Check FGA log growth rate
SELECT to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI') as minute,
       COUNT(*) as audit_entries,
       ROUND(COUNT(*) * AVG(vsize(sql_text))/1024/1024, 2) as estimated_mb
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE timestamp > SYSDATE - 1/24  -- Last hour
GROUP BY to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI')
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

## 4. Production Rollout Plan

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 10 tables in one schema
2. **Monitor**: Check log growth and system performance
3. **Scale Up**: If all looks good, increase to 50 tables
4. **Full Rollout**: After confirming stability, proceed with remaining tables in batches

## 5. Cleanup Plan (if needed)

```sql
-- To remove FGA policies if needed
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name
    FROM dba_audit_policies
    WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
  ) LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
        object_schema => r.owner,
        object_name   => r.object_name,
        policy_name   => r.policy_name
      );
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error dropping ' || r.policy_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the first batch of FGA policies?

### User Input

tablespace is SYSTEM	and free MB is 63 is good to start with this for big prod system though its only update, delete and insert but not select . I been thniking we need alter, drop and create  

### Planner Response

I understand your concerns about the SYSTEM tablespace and the need to monitor DDL operations. Here's a focused approach:

## 1. FGA in SYSTEM Tablespace

63MB free in SYSTEM is quite low for production. Let's address this first:

```sql
-- Check if we can move FGA_LOG$ to a different tablespace
-- First, create a dedicated tablespace for FGA (recommended size: 1-2GB)
CREATE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts 
DATAFILE '+DATA' SIZE 1G 
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE 10G;

-- Move FGA log to the new tablespace
ALTER TABLE sys.fga_log$ MOVE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;

-- Rebuild indexes
ALTER INDEX sys.fga_log$_obj$idx REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.fga_log$ntime$idx REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
ALTER INDEX sys.fga_log$time$idx REBUILD TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts;
```

## 2. Monitoring DDL Operations (ALTER, DROP, CREATE)

For DDL auditing, we have two options:

### Option A: Standard Auditing (Recommended for DDL)
```sql
-- Enable standard auditing for DDL
AUDIT CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE PROCEDURE, ALTER PROCEDURE, DROP PROCEDURE BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE INDEX, ALTER INDEX, DROP INDEX BY ACCESS;
-- Add other DDL statements as needed

-- View DDL audit trail
SELECT username, obj_name, action_name, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')
FROM dba_audit_trail
WHERE action_name IN ('CREATE TABLE','ALTER TABLE','DROP TABLE','CREATE INDEX','ALTER INDEX','DROP INDEX')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Option B: FGA for DDL (More Complex)
FGA can capture DDL but requires a different approach:
```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'SYS',
    object_name     => 'OBJ$',
    policy_name     => 'AUDIT_DDL_CHANGES',
    audit_condition => '1=1',
    statement_types => 'CREATE,ALTER,DROP',
    audit_column    => 'NAME',
    enable          => TRUE
  );
END;
/
```

## 3. Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Move FGA_LOG$ out of SYSTEM tablespace
   - Set up standard auditing for DDL operations

2. **Next Steps**:
   - Start with FGA on 5-10 critical tables
   - Monitor growth in the new tablespace
   - Review audit data volume

3. **Monitoring**:
   ```sql
   -- Check FGA log growth
   SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
   FROM dba_segments 
   WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';

   -- Check standard audit trail size
   SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
   FROM dba_segments 
   WHERE segment_name = 'AUD$';
   ```

4. **Cleanup** (set up a weekly job):
   ```sql
   -- For FGA
   BEGIN
     DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
       audit_trail_type         => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
       use_last_arch_timestamp  => TRUE,
       container                => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CONTAINER_CURRENT
     );
   END;
   /

   -- For standard audit
   BEGIN
     DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
       audit_trail_type         => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
       use_last_arch_timestamp  => TRUE
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

Would you like me to proceed with any of these steps? I recommend starting with moving FGA_LOG$ out of the SYSTEM tablespace first.

### User Input

for this part CREATE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts 
DATAFILE '+DATA' SIZE 2G 
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE 10G; cant we user the same dba_audit_trail tablespace thought it has diffrent fileds where its username on dba_fga_audit_trail you used db_user for example but some fields are the same e.g sql_text and sql_bind etc 

### Planner Response

You're right! Let's use the existing `SYSAUX` tablespace for the FGA log instead of creating a new one. Here's the updated approach:

```sql
-- 1. Check current location of FGA_LOG$
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';

-- 2. Move FGA_LOG$ to SYSAUX (if not already there)
ALTER TABLE sys.fga_log$ MOVE TABLESPACE SYSAUX;

-- 3. Rebuild indexes in SYSAUX
ALTER INDEX sys.fga_log$_obj$idx REBUILD TABLESPACE SYSAUX;
ALTER INDEX sys.fga_log$ntime$idx REBUILD TABLESPACE SYSAUX;
ALTER INDEX sys.fga_log$time$idx REBUILD TABLESPACE SYSAUX;

-- 4. Verify the move
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
```

### Key Points:
- **SYSAUX** is the recommended tablespace for database components like FGA
- This avoids creating additional tablespaces while keeping FGA data separate from the critical SYSTEM tablespace
- Both `dba_audit_trail` (standard) and `dba_fga_audit_trail` will be in SYSAUX
- The field differences (`username` vs `db_user`) are just column naming differences - the data is stored efficiently

Would you like me to proceed with moving the FGA log to SYSAUX?

select * from dba_segments where segment_name in (
select index_name from dba_indexes where table_name = 'AUD$'

### Planner Response

I see the issue with the LONG datatype in FGA_LOG$. Let's use the proper DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT package to move both standard and FGA audit trails:

```sql
-- 1. First, check current locations
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name IN ('AUD$','FGA_LOG$');

-- 2. Create a new tablespace for audit data (if needed)
-- You can use existing USERS tablespace as shown in your example

-- 3. Move standard audit trail to USERS tablespace
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(
    audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
    audit_trail_location_value => 'USERS'
  );
END;
/

-- 4. Move FGA audit trail to USERS tablespace
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(
    audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD,
    audit_trail_location_value => 'USERS'
  );
END;
/

-- 5. Verify the moves
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name IN ('AUD$','FGA_LOG$');

-- 6. Check indexes (should be in USERS tablespace now)
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name IN (
  SELECT index_name 
  FROM dba_indexes 
  WHERE table_name IN ('AUD$','FGA_LOG$')
  OR (table_owner = 'SYS' AND table_name = 'FGA_LOG$')
);
```

Key points:
1. Always use DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT for moving audit trails
2. The package handles all the internal details (LONG columns, indexes, etc.)
3. This is the Oracle-recommended way to manage audit trail locations

Would you like me to proceed with these steps? Also, would you like to set up any automatic cleanup jobs while we're at it?

### User Input

FGA_LOG$	SYSTEM	0.0625
AUD$	SYSTEM	9724 oooh now i see we have standard at system with more space that means we can still use system we may just incrae the space of fqa_log

### Planner Response

I see that FGA_LOG$ is quite small (0.0625MB) and there's plenty of space in the SYSTEM tablespace (9.7GB for AUD$). Since this is a production system, here's a straightforward plan:

1. **Leave FGA_LOG$ in SYSTEM** - It's tiny and won't impact performance
2. **Monitor growth** - Keep an eye on it as we implement FGA
3. **Start with a small batch** - Test with a few tables first

Here's how to monitor FGA log growth:

```sql
-- Check current FGA log size
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';

-- Check free space in SYSTEM tablespace
SELECT tablespace_name, 
       ROUND(SUM(bytes)/1024/1024) "Free MB"
FROM dba_free_space
WHERE tablespace_name = 'SYSTEM'
GROUP BY tablespace_name;
```

Would you like to proceed with creating FGA policies for a small test batch of tables? We can start with just 5-10 tables to monitor the impact.

### User Input

SYSTEM	63

### Planner Response

I see only 63MB free in the SYSTEM tablespace, which is quite tight. Let's be cautious and:

1. **Check the autoextend settings** for the SYSTEM datafile:
   ```sql
   SELECT file_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB", 
          maxbytes/1024/1024 "Max MB", 
          autoextensible, increment_by*8/1024 "Next Extend MB"
   FROM dba_data_files 
   WHERE tablespace_name = 'SYSTEM';
   ```

2. **If autoextend is ON**, we can proceed with a small test batch (5 tables)
3. **If autoextend is OFF**, we should:
   - Either enable it: 
     ```sql
     ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE '[datafile_path]' AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE 10G;
     ```
   - Or move FGA_LOG$ to SYSAUX using the proper method

Would you like me to check the autoextend settings first? This will help us decide the safest approach.

### Monitoring Plan for Next 24 Hours:

1. **Every 2 Hours**:
   - Run the FGA log size check
   - Check for any ORA- errors in alert log
   - Run the audit records query to see volume

2. **After 24 Hours**:
   - Check total FGA log growth
   - Review system performance metrics
   - Check for any failed policy creations

3. **If Issues Arise**:
   - If FGA log grows too quickly, we can:
     - Implement a cleanup job
     - Move FGA log to a dedicated tablespace
     - Adjust the audit policy

Would you like me to proceed with executing this script?

### Planner Response

You're absolutely right to double-check! The `DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY` only supports DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) and SELECT. For DDL operations (ALTER, CREATE, DROP), we need to use standard auditing. Here's the corrected approach:

### For DML Operations (FGA):
```sql
-- This is correct for DML operations
DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
  object_schema   => r.owner,
  object_name     => r.table_name,
  policy_name     => v_policy_name,
  statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',  -- Only these are valid
  enable         => TRUE
);
```

### For DDL Operations (Standard Auditing):
You would need separate standard auditing for DDL:

```sql
-- Example for standard auditing of DDL
AUDIT ALTER ANY TABLE BY ACCESS;
AUDIT DROP ANY TABLE BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE TABLE BY ACCESS;
```

### Recommendation:
1. Keep the current FGA script for DML operations
2. If you need to audit DDL, add standard auditing separately
3. For a complete audit solution, you might want both:
   - FGA for DML (data changes)
   - Standard auditing for DDL (schema changes)

Would you like me to modify the script to include standard auditing for DDL operations as well?

### User Input

will this -- Example for standard auditing of DDL
AUDIT ALTER ANY TABLE BY ACCESS;
AUDIT DROP ANY TABLE BY ACCESS;
AUDIT CREATE TABLE BY ACCESS;  require  spfile DB, extended or we can do it at spfile DB only  the current is enough

### Planner Response

Let me clarify the auditing requirements:

1. **Standard Auditing (for DDL)**:
   - Works with `AUDIT_TRAIL=DB` (no restart needed)
   - Basic DDL auditing is available without `EXTENDED`
   - For SQL text and bind variables, `EXTENDED` is needed

2. **Current Setup**:
   - If you have `AUDIT_TRAIL=DB` (without EXTENDED), you can still audit DDL, but with limited information
   - To check your current setting:
     ```sql
     SELECT name, value FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'audit_trail';
     ```

3. **Recommendation**:
   - For now, proceed with FGA for DML (already in script)
   - For DDL auditing, use this basic command:
     ```sql
     AUDIT ALTER ANY TABLE, DROP ANY TABLE, CREATE TABLE BY ACCESS;
     ```
   - This will track DDL operations but without SQL text

4. **If you need full DDL auditing**:
   - Requires `AUDIT_TRAIL=DB,EXTENDED` in spfile
   - Database restart needed
   - Then you can use:
     ```sql
     AUDIT ALTER ANY TABLE BY ACCESS;
     AUDIT DROP ANY TABLE BY ACCESS;
     AUDIT CREATE TABLE BY ACCESS;
     ```

Would you like to:
1. Proceed with basic DDL auditing (no restart needed), or
2. Schedule a maintenance window to enable extended auditing?

-- 3. Verification queries
PROMPT ===== VERIFICATION =====
PROMPT -- Check DDL auditing is enabled:
SELECT * FROM dba_stmt_audit_opts 
WHERE audit_option IN ('ALTER ANY TABLE', 'DROP ANY TABLE', 'CREATE TABLE');

PROMPT -- Check FGA policies:
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;

PROMPT -- Check FGA log size:
SELECT segment_name, tablespace_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
```

### Key Improvements:
1. Added DDL auditing for table operations
2. More robust error handling
3. Dynamic SQL to avoid PL/SQL optimization issues
4. Progress reporting every 50 tables
5. Verification queries at the end

### Monitoring Commands (save these):
```sql
-- Check audit records
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_trail 
WHERE timestamp > SYSDATE - 1
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Check FGA audit trail
SELECT * FROM dba_fga_audit_trail 
WHERE timestamp > SYSDATE - 1
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Monitor FGA log growth
SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 "Size MB"
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$';
```

Would you like me to execute this script now?

### Planner Response

I see the issue. Let's use the simpler version that worked in testing but with a limit of 5 tables first. Here's the corrected script:

```sql
-- 1. First, check which tables we'll be working with
SELECT owner, table_name
FROM all_tables 
WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
AND ROWNUM <= 5;  -- Just show first 5 for verification

-- 2. Create FGA policies (test with 5 tables first)
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
  v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30);
  v_count NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    AND ROWNUM <= 5  -- Start with just 5 tables
    ORDER BY owner, table_name
  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      -- Create a valid policy name (max 30 chars, no special chars)
      v_policy_name := 'FGA_' || 
                      SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(r.owner, '[^A-Z0-9]', ''), 1, 10) || '_' ||

        DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(

          object_name   => r.table_name,
          policy_name   => v_policy_name
        );
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Dropped existing policy');
      EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN 
          IF SQLCODE != -28112 THEN  -- Ignore "policy does not exist" error
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Error dropping: ' || SQLERRM);

        policy_name     => v_policy_name,
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        enable         => TRUE
      );
      
      v_count := v_count + 1;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Successfully added policy');
      
    EXCEPTION

    END;
  END LOOP;

END;
/

-- 3. Verify the policies were created
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;
```

Key improvements:
1. Limited to 5 tables initially
2. Better error handling and feedback
3. Cleaner output with indentation
4. Proper cleanup of existing policies
5. Verification query at the end

After this works, we can:
1. Check the audit trail
2. Monitor performance
3. Scale up to more tables if everything looks good

Would you like me to run this simplified version first?

### User Input

see error

### Planner Response

I see the issue. The error indicates that the `DBMS_FGA` package is not accessible, which could be due to missing privileges or the package not being installed. Let's check and fix this:

1. First, verify if you have the necessary privileges:

```sql
-- Check if you have execute privilege on DBMS_FGA
SELECT * FROM dba_tab_privs 
WHERE table_name = 'DBMS_FGA' 
AND grantee IN (
    SELECT granted_role FROM dba_role_privs 
    CONNECT BY PRIOR granted_role = grantee 
    START WITH grantee = USER
    UNION
    SELECT USER FROM dual
);
```

2. If you don't have the required privileges, you'll need to be granted them by a DBA:

```sql
-- A DBA needs to run:
GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_FGA TO your_username;
-- Or better, grant the AUDIT_ADMIN role:
GRANT AUDIT_ADMIN TO your_username;
```

3. If the package doesn't exist (unlikely in a standard Oracle installation), it needs to be installed by running `@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catfga.sql` as SYS.

4. Try this simplified test with just one table first:

```sql
-- Test with a single table
DECLARE
  v_owner VARCHAR2(30) := 'LIS_OWNER';  -- Replace with actual schema
  v_table VARCHAR2(30) := 'TEST_TABLE'; -- Replace with actual table
  v_policy VARCHAR2(30) := 'FGA_TEST_1';
BEGIN
  -- Drop if exists
  BEGIN
    DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
      object_schema => v_owner,
      object_name   => v_table,
      policy_name   => v_policy
    );
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
  END;
  
  -- Add policy
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => v_owner,
    object_name     => v_table,
    policy_name     => v_policy,
    statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    enable         => TRUE
  );
  
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Successfully created policy FGA_TEST_1');
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
END;
/
```

Could you:
1. Try running the privilege check query first?
2. Let me know if you get any errors with that?
3. If you have DBA access, we can proceed with granting the necessary privileges.

  END;
  
END;
/

-- Check if we can see any FGA policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies 
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
```

**Important**: 
1. Replace `'LIS_OWNER'` with an actual schema name from your database
2. Replace `'TEST_TABLE'` with an actual table name from that schema

This script will:
1. Test basic DBMS_OUTPUT
2. Attempt to drop any existing test policy
3. Create a new FGA policy
4. Verify the policy was created
5. Show any existing FGA policies

Please run this and share the output. This will help us identify exactly where the issue is occurring.

WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;
```

This script will:
1. Select one table each from LIS, LOV_AGMT, and INTG_AGMT schemas
2. Create FGA policies for these tables
3. Show progress and any errors
4. Verify the policies were created

After this works, we can:
1. Check the audit trail
2. Monitor performance
3. Scale up to more tables if everything looks good

Would you like me to run this test script?

### User Input

see error 

### Planner Response

I see the issue. The error indicates that the `DBMS_FGA` package exists, but there might be an issue with the way we're calling it. Let's try a simpler approach with just one table to identify the problem:

```sql
-- Test with a single table
DECLARE
  v_owner VARCHAR2(30) := 'LIS';      -- Using LIS schema
  v_table VARCHAR2(30) := 'CUSTOMER'; -- Replace with an actual table from LIS
  v_policy VARCHAR2(30) := 'FGA_TEST_1';
BEGIN

    ) LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('   - Found policy: ' || 
                          r.owner || '.' || r.object_name || ' - ' || r.policy_name);

END;
/

-- Check if we can see any FGA policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies 
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
```

**Important**: 
1. Replace `'CUSTOMER'` with an actual table name from the LIS schema. You can find one using:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name 
   FROM all_tables 
   WHERE owner = 'LIS' 
   AND ROWNUM = 1;
   ```

This script will:
1. Test basic DBMS_OUTPUT
2. Test direct access to DBMS_FGA
3. Attempt to drop any existing test policy
4. Create a new FGA policy
5. Verify the policy was created
6. Show any existing FGA policies

Please:
1. Replace `'CUSTOMER'` with an actual table name from the LIS schema
2. Run this script
3. Share the complete output

This will help us identify exactly where the issue is occurring.

ORDER BY owner, object_name;

### Planner Response

I see that the script partially worked! Let's check the current FGA policies and then proceed with adding more. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's see what policies were created:

```sql
-- Check existing FGA policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY owner, object_name;
```

2. Let's check the audit trail to see if any DML operations were captured:

```sql
-- Check FGA audit trail (most recent first)
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT db_user, 
           to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
           object_schema, 
           object_name, 
           policy_name,
           sql_text
    FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

3. If everything looks good, we can proceed with adding more policies. Let's do it in batches of 10 schemas at a time:

```sql
-- Get next batch of schemas
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM all_tables 
WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
AND owner NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT object_owner 
    FROM dba_audit_policies 
    WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
)
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

4. Once you confirm the first batch worked well, we can create a script for the next batch. Would you like me to:

1. Show you the current audit data
2. Proceed with the next batch of schemas
3. Or check something else?

Please let me know which tables/schemas were successfully processed and if you'd like to continue with more.

### User Input

if it worked lets do all like lis , lov and intg

### Planner Response

I'll help you create FGA policies for all LIS, LOV, and INTG schemas. Let's proceed with a batch approach to monitor progress and catch any issues early.

This script will:
1. Process all tables in LIS%, LOV%, and INTG% schemas
2. Process in batches of 10 tables at a time
3. Show progress with percentage complete
4. Commit after each batch to avoid large transactions
5. Provide a summary at the end
6. Show any errors that occurred

**Important Notes:**
1. The script includes error handling to continue if a single table fails
2. It skips system schemas and recycle bin objects
3. It shows progress after each batch
4. You can monitor the progress in the output

Would you like me to run this script now? Or would you prefer to review it first?

### User Input

we have a break point 

### Planner Response

Let's check the current state of the FGA policies and then proceed with the next steps:

```sql
-- Check current FGA policies
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner;

-- Check for any errors in the last run
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT db_user, 
           to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,

           object_name, 
           policy_name,
           sql_text
    FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
    WHERE returncode != 0
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;

-- See which schemas still need FGA policies
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as tables_to_audit
FROM all_tables

    SELECT object_owner, object_name 
    FROM dba_audit_policies 
    WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
)
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner;
```

Please share the output of these queries, and I'll help you continue from where we left off.

### User Input

sorry we have some policies  break your -- quries into separate sql  e.g -- Check current FGA policies reprate from others


### Planner Response

I'll help you check the current FGA policies with separate SQL queries. Here's the first one:

```sql
-- 1. Check current FGA policies count by owner
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner;
```

Please run this query and share the results. Once you've shared the output, I'll provide the next query to check for any errors in the last run.

### Planner Response

I'll help you split this into smaller, manageable chunks. Let's start with the first part:

### 1. First, let's create a table to track our progress:

```sql
-- Create a table to track FGA policy creation progress
CREATE TABLE fga_creation_log (
    log_id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    owner VARCHAR2(30),
    table_name VARCHAR2(30),
    policy_name VARCHAR2(30),
    status VARCHAR2(20),
    error_message VARCHAR2(4000),
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT fga_creation_log_pk PRIMARY KEY (log_id)
);
```

### 2. Get the total count of tables to process:

```sql
-- Get total number of tables to process
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tables
FROM all_tables 
WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
AND owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','MDSYS')
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%';
```

### 3. Create a procedure to process a single table:

```sql
-- Create a procedure to process a single table
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE create_fga_policy_for_table(
    p_owner IN VARCHAR2,
    p_table_name IN VARCHAR2
) IS
    v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30);
    v_error_msg VARCHAR2(4000);
BEGIN
    -- Create policy name (max 30 chars)
    v_policy_name := 'FGA_' || 
                    SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(p_owner, '[^A-Z0-9]', ''), 1, 5) || '_' || 
                    SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(p_table_name, '[^A-Z0-9]', ''), 1, 15);
    
    -- Log start
    INSERT INTO fga_creation_log (owner, table_name, policy_name, status)
    VALUES (p_owner, p_table_name, v_policy_name, 'STARTED');
    COMMIT;
    
    -- Drop policy if it exists
    BEGIN
        EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 
            'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
            p_owner || ''', ''' || 
            p_table_name || ''', ''' || 
            v_policy_name || '''); END;';
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN 
            v_error_msg := 'DROP POLICY: ' || SQLERRM;
            UPDATE fga_creation_log 
            SET status = 'WARNING', 
                error_message = v_error_msg
            WHERE owner = p_owner 
            AND table_name = p_table_name
            AND policy_name = v_policy_name
            AND status = 'STARTED';
            COMMIT;
    END;
    
    -- Add new policy
    BEGIN
        EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 
            'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(' ||
            'object_schema => ''' || p_owner || ''', ' ||
            'object_name => ''' || p_table_name || ''', ' ||
            'policy_name => ''' || v_policy_name || ''', ' ||
            'statement_types => ''INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE'', ' ||
            'enable => TRUE); END;';
            
        -- Update log on success
        UPDATE fga_creation_log 
        SET status = 'COMPLETED'
        WHERE owner = p_owner 
        AND table_name = p_table_name
        AND policy_name = v_policy_name
        AND status = 'STARTED';
        COMMIT;
        
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN
            v_error_msg := 'ADD POLICY: ' || SQLERRM;
            UPDATE fga_creation_log 
            SET status = 'FAILED', 
                error_message = v_error_msg
            WHERE owner = p_owner 
            AND table_name = p_table_name
            AND policy_name = v_policy_name
            AND status = 'STARTED';
            COMMIT;
            RAISE;
    END;
    
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        v_error_msg := 'UNEXPECTED: ' || SQLERRM;
        UPDATE fga_creation_log 
        SET status = 'FAILED', 
            error_message = v_error_msg
        WHERE owner = p_owner 
        AND table_name = p_table_name
        AND policy_name = v_policy_name
        AND status = 'STARTED';
        COMMIT;
        RAISE;
END create_fga_policy_for_table;
/
```

### 4. Create a procedure to process tables in batches:

```sql
-- Create a procedure to process tables in batches
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE process_fga_policies_batch(
    p_batch_size IN NUMBER DEFAULT 10,
    p_offset IN NUMBER DEFAULT 0
) IS
    v_processed NUMBER := 0;
    v_total_tables NUMBER;
    v_start_time TIMESTAMP := SYSTIMESTAMP;
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Starting FGA policy creation at ' || 
                         TO_CHAR(v_start_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'));
    
    -- Get total tables
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_total_tables
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
    AND owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','MDSYS')
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%';
    
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Total tables to process: ' || v_total_tables);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Processing batch of ' || p_batch_size || ' tables...');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------------------------------------');
    
    -- Process tables in batch
    FOR r IN (
        SELECT owner, table_name
        FROM all_tables 
        WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
        AND owner NOT IN ('SYS','SYSTEM','SYSMAN','XDB','CTXSYS','DBSNMP','ORDSYS','ORDPLUGINS','MDSYS')
        AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
        AND (owner, table_name) NOT IN (
            SELECT owner, table_name 
            FROM fga_creation_log 
            WHERE status = 'COMPLETED'
        )
        ORDER BY owner, table_name
        OFFSET p_offset ROWS FETCH NEXT p_batch_size ROWS ONLY
    ) LOOP
        BEGIN
            create_fga_policy_for_table(r.owner, r.table_name);
            v_processed := v_processed + 1;
            
            -- Show progress
            IF MOD(v_processed, 5) = 0 THEN
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Processed ' || v_processed || ' tables...');
            END IF;
            
        EXCEPTION
            WHEN OTHERS THEN
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error processing ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name || 
                                    ': ' || SQLERRM);
        END;
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Show summary
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------------------------------------');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Batch processing completed at ' || 
                         TO_CHAR(SYSTIMESTAMP, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'));
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Total tables processed: ' || v_processed);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Total time: ' || 
                         EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (SYSTIMESTAMP - v_start_time)) || ' seconds');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------------------------------------');
    
    -- Show status summary
    FOR r IN (
        SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
        FROM fga_creation_log
        GROUP BY status
    ) LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(r.status || ': ' || r.count);
    END LOOP;
END process_fga_policies_batch;
/
```

### 5. Run the batch processing:

```sql
-- Execute the batch processing (process 10 tables at a time)
EXEC process_fga_policies_batch(p_batch_size => 10, p_offset => 0);
```

### 6. Check the progress:

```sql
-- Check the current status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM fga_creation_log
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY status;

-- Check the most recent processed tables
SELECT owner, table_name, policy_name, status, 
       TO_CHAR(created_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as created_date,
       error_message
FROM fga_creation_log
ORDER BY created_date DESC
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;

-- Check for any errors
SELECT owner, table_name, policy_name, error_message
FROM fga_creation_log
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
ORDER BY created_date DESC;
```

### 7. To continue with the next batch:

```sql
-- Get the current offset (number of completed records)
SELECT COUNT(*) as completed_count 
FROM fga_creation_log 
WHERE status = 'COMPLETED';

-- Run the next batch (replace 10 with the number of completed records from above)
EXEC process_fga_policies_batch(p_batch_size => 10, p_offset => 10);
```

### 8. Verify the created policies:

```sql
-- Check the count of created policies
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY owner;

-- Check for any errors in the audit trail
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT db_user, 
           to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
           object_schema, 
           object_name, 
           policy_name,
           sql_text
    FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
    WHERE returncode != 0
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

### 9. Cleanup (if needed):

```sql
-- If you need to clean up and start over
/*
DROP PROCEDURE create_fga_policy_for_table;
DROP PROCEDURE process_fga_policies_batch;
DROP TABLE fga_creation_log;
*/
```

This approach provides several benefits:
1. Progress tracking in a table
2. Ability to resume from where it left off
3. Detailed error logging
4. Better control over batch processing
5. Ability to monitor progress

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

### User Input

provide a simple query to list all fga policies

### Planner Response

Here's a simple query to list all FGA policies:

```sql
SELECT 
    policy_owner,
    policy_name,
    object_owner,
    object_name,
    enabled,
    policy_column,
    sel, ins, upd, del,  -- Shows which DML operations are audited
    to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as created_date
FROM 
    dba_audit_policies
ORDER BY 
    policy_owner, 
    object_owner, 
    object_name;
```

For a more concise view, you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    object_owner as schema_name,
    object_name as table_name,
    policy_name,
    enabled,
    sel, ins, upd, del
FROM 
    dba_audit_policies
ORDER BY 
    object_owner, 
    object_name;
```

If you only want to see the count of policies by schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    object_owner as schema_name, 
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM 
    dba_audit_policies
GROUP BY 
    object_owner
ORDER BY 
    object_owner;
```

### Planner Response

I understand you're trying to see what FGA policies exist in production. Here's a simple query to list all FGA policies:

```sql
-- List all FGA policies with basic info
SELECT 
    policy_owner,
    policy_name,
    object_owner,
    object_name,
    enabled,
    sel, ins, upd, del,
    to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as created_date
FROM 
    dba_audit_policies
ORDER BY 
    object_owner, 
    object_name,
    policy_name;
```

To see just the count of policies by schema:

```sql
-- Count of FGA policies by schema
SELECT 
    object_owner as schema_name, 
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM 
    dba_audit_policies
GROUP BY 
    object_owner
ORDER BY 
    object_owner;
```

If you want to see recent FGA audit entries (if any exist):

```sql
-- Recent FGA audit entries
SELECT 
    db_user,
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
    object_schema, 
    object_name, 
    policy_name,
    statement_type
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1  -- Last 24 hours
ORDER BY 
    timestamp DESC
FETCH FIRST 50 ROWS ONLY;
```

Try these queries in your production environment to see what FGA policies currently exist. Let me know what you find, and I can help you create any missing policies.

### User Input

lets start again maybe we are failing because we dont have extended in ua4 we had extended i forgot to switch it off or should i swith off and try again

### Planner Response

Let's check and set up the audit configuration properly. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's check the current audit settings:

```sql
-- Check current audit settings
SELECT name, value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name LIKE '%audit%' 
   OR name LIKE 'audit%'
ORDER BY name;
```

2. Check if unified auditing is enabled:

```sql
-- Check if unified auditing is enabled
SELECT value 
FROM v$option 
WHERE parameter = 'Unified Auditing';

-- Or for older versions
SELECT * FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Unified Auditing';
```

3. If you need to switch to standard auditing (non-extended), you can set:

```sql
-- Set standard auditing (no restart needed for this parameter)
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB SCOPE=SPFILE;

-- Then restart the database
-- SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
-- STARTUP;
```

4. For FGA, we don't need extended auditing. Let's verify FGA is enabled:

```sql
-- Check if FGA is enabled
SELECT value 
FROM v$option 
WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';

-- Or for older versions
SELECT * FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';
```

5. Let's try a simple FGA policy on a test table:

```sql
-- First, check if we can create a test table
CREATE TABLE test_fga_audit (
    id NUMBER,
    data VARCHAR2(100)
);

-- Create a simple FGA policy
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => USER,
    object_name     => 'TEST_FGA_AUDIT',
    policy_name     => 'TEST_FGA_POLICY',
    audit_condition => NULL,
    audit_column    => NULL,
    handler_schema  => NULL,
    handler_module  => NULL,
    enable          => TRUE,
    statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE'
  );
END;
/

-- Check if the policy was created
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies 
WHERE policy_name = 'TEST_FGA_POLICY';

-- Clean up (when done)
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
    object_schema => USER,
    object_name   => 'TEST_FGA_AUDIT',
    policy_name   => 'TEST_FGA_POLICY'
  );
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'DROP TABLE test_fga_audit';
END;
/
```

6. If you want to see all FGA-related parameters:

```sql
-- Show all FGA-related parameters
SELECT name, value, display_value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name LIKE '%fga%' 
   OR name LIKE '%audit%'
ORDER BY name;
```

Could you run these queries and share the output? This will help us determine the current configuration and what might need to be changed.

Also, please let me know:
1. What version of Oracle are you using? (Run `SELECT * FROM v$version;`)
2. Are you using a pluggable database (PDB)? (Run `SELECT name, cdb, con_id FROM v$database;`)

This information will help me provide more specific guidance for your environment.

### User Input

what exactly causes slow perfomance across the system when we add extended it log are full  or not blocking select audit or not when audit by acess we do not focus just only on private user a sit return system users also??

### Planner Response

# Performance Impact of Extended Auditing

Extended auditing can cause performance issues due to several factors:

## Main Performance Issues

1. **I/O Contention**:
   - Extended auditing writes detailed logs to the database
   - This creates significant I/O load, especially for high-transaction systems
   - The SYSTEM tablespace can fill up quickly, causing errors

2. **CPU Usage**:
   - Each audited operation requires additional CPU cycles
   - The database must write audit records synchronously

3. **Blocking Issues**:
   - `AUDIT BY ACCESS` is more resource-intensive than `AUDIT BY SESSION`
   - It creates an audit record for every access, not just once per session

4. **Audit Trail Growth**:
   - Unmanaged audit trails can grow uncontrollably
   - This affects backup times and storage requirements

## Recommendations

1. **Use FGA Instead**:
   ```sql
   -- Instead of:
   AUDIT SELECT ON schema.table BY ACCESS;
   
   -- Use:
   BEGIN
     DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
       object_schema   => 'SCHEMA',
       object_name     => 'TABLE',
       policy_name     => 'AUDIT_SELECT_ACCESS',
       audit_condition => NULL,
       audit_column    => NULL,
       enable          => TRUE,
       statement_types => 'SELECT'
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

2. **Targeted Auditing**:
   - Only audit specific users or tables that require it
   - Avoid using `AUDIT ALL` or `AUDIT ANY` privileges

3. **Regular Maintenance**:
   ```sql
   -- Schedule regular purges of audit trail
   BEGIN
     DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
       audit_trail_type         => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_ALL,
       use_last_arch_timestamp  => TRUE
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

4. **Move Audit Trail**:
   ```sql
   -- Move audit trail to a dedicated tablespace
   CREATE TABLESPACE audit_ts 
   DATAFILE '/path/to/audit01.dbf' SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON;

   BEGIN
     DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(
       audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
       audit_trail_location_value => 'AUDIT_TS'
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

5. **For Your Specific Case**:
   - If you only need to audit DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), use FGA instead of standard auditing
   - FGA is more efficient for monitoring specific operations
   - It also allows you to capture the actual SQL statements and bind variables

Would you like me to provide specific queries to check your current audit settings and help optimize them?

### User Input

are yu sure we can get DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and sql text and sql bind using fga with setting EXTENDED

### Planner Response

# FGA for DML with SQL Text and Bind Variables

Yes, you can capture DML operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) along with SQL text and bind variables using Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA) with the `AUDIT_TRAIL=DB_EXTENDED` parameter. Here's how it works:

## 1. First, ensure extended auditing is enabled:

```sql
-- Check current audit settings
SELECT name, value, display_value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name = 'audit_trail';

-- If not set to DB_EXTENDED, set it (requires restart)
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB_EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE;
-- Then restart the database
-- SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
-- STARTUP;
```

## 2. Create an FGA policy to capture DML with extended information:

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema      => 'SCHEMA_NAME',  -- Replace with your schema
    object_name        => 'TABLE_NAME',   -- Replace with your table
    policy_name        => 'AUDIT_DML_ACTIVITY',
    audit_condition    => NULL,           -- Audit all rows
    audit_column       => NULL,           -- All columns
    handler_schema     => NULL,           -- No handler
    handler_module     => NULL,           -- No handler
    enable             => TRUE,
    statement_types    => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',  -- DML operations
    audit_trail        => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED,   -- Capture SQL text and binds
    audit_column_opts  => DBMS_FGA.ANY_COLUMNS
  );
END;
/
```

## 3. To view the captured DML with SQL text and bind variables:

```sql
-- View FGA audit trail with SQL text and bind variables
SELECT 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
    db_user,
    os_user,
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    policy_name,
    statement_type,
    sql_text,
    sql_bind
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1  -- Last 24 hours
    AND object_name = 'TABLE_NAME'  -- Filter by specific table
ORDER BY 
    timestamp DESC;
```

## Important Notes:

1. **Performance Impact**: 
   - Capturing SQL text and bind variables adds overhead
   - Each DML statement requires additional processing and I/O
   - The audit trail will grow much faster

2. **Storage Requirements**:
   - The `DBA_FGA_AUDIT_TRAIL` table will grow quickly
   - Consider purging old records regularly:
   ```sql
   -- Example purge of records older than 30 days
   DELETE FROM fga_log$ 
   WHERE ntimestamp# < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '30' DAY;
   COMMIT;
   ```

3. **Alternative for Better Performance**:
   If you only need to know that DML occurred (not the actual values), you can use:
   ```sql
   audit_trail => DBMS_FGA.DB  -- Standard audit trail (no SQL text/binds)
   ```

4. **For Specific Columns**:
   If you only need to audit specific columns, you can specify them:
   ```sql
   audit_column => 'SALARY, BONUS'  -- Only audit these columns
   ```

Would you like me to help you set up a specific policy for your needs?

### Planner Response

The script should work regardless of the `AUDIT_TRAIL` setting because:

1. FGA policies are created in either `DB` or `DB_EXTENDED` mode
2. The `AUDIT_TRAIL` parameter only affects standard auditing, not FGA
3. The script doesn't specify `audit_trail => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED`, so it uses the default behavior

However, if you're experiencing issues, let's check the current settings and modify the script for better error handling:

1. First, check the current audit settings:

```sql
SELECT name, value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name = 'audit_trail';
```

2. Here's an enhanced version of your script with better error handling:

```

Key improvements in this version:
1. Better error handling and reporting
2. Checks if policy exists before trying to create it
3. Drops existing policy with the same name
4. Explicitly sets `audit_trail => DBMS_FGA.DB` to ensure compatibility
5. Provides a clear summary of success/error counts

If this still fails, please share the specific error messages you're seeing.

Key changes made:
1. Added `OR owner LIKE 'INTG%'` to both SELECT statements to include INTG schemas
2. Kept all the enhanced error handling and progress reporting
3. Maintained the limit of 5 tables for testing

If this works, we can remove the `ROWNUM <= 5` limit to process all tables in these schemas. Would you like me to proceed with that?

### User Input

what about standard audit can we check the policies now

### Planner Response

I'll help you check the standard audit policies. Here are the key queries to review your current audit settings:

## 1. Check Standard Audit Settings

```sql
-- Check current audit settings
SELECT name, value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name LIKE '%audit%' 
ORDER BY name;
```

## 2. View All Standard Audit Policies

```sql
-- View all standard audit policies
SELECT * FROM dba_stmt_audit_opts 
ORDER BY user_name, audit_option;
```

## 3. Check Audit Trail Contents

```sql
-- View recent audit entries
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        username,
        to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
        action_name,
        obj_name,
        returncode
    FROM dba_audit_trail
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
) 
WHERE ROWNUM <= 20;
```

## 4. Check System-Level Auditing

```sql
-- Check system-level auditing
SELECT * FROM dba_priv_audit_opts 
ORDER BY user_name, privilege;
```

## 5. Check Object-Level Auditing

```sql
-- Check object-level auditing
SELECT * FROM dba_obj_audit_opts 
ORDER BY owner, object_name;
```

## 6. Check If Auditing is Enabled

```sql
-- Check if auditing is enabled
SELECT name, value 
FROM v$option 
WHERE parameter IN ('Unified Auditing', 'Fine-grained auditing');
```

## 7. Check Audit File Destination

```sql
-- Check audit file destination
SELECT name, value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name IN ('audit_file_dest', 'audit_sys_operations');
```

## 8. Check for Failed Logins

```sql
-- Check for failed logins
SELECT username, to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as attempt_time,
       os_username, userhost, returncode
FROM dba_audit_session
WHERE returncode != 0
AND timestamp > SYSDATE - 7  -- Last 7 days
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## 9. Check Audit Trail Size

```sql
-- Check audit trail size
SELECT 
    segment_name, 
    ROUND(bytes/1024/1024, 2) as size_mb,
    blocks,
    extents
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name IN ('AUD$', 'FGA_LOG$')
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'TOTAL' as segment_name,
    SUM(ROUND(bytes/1024/1024, 2)) as size_mb,
    SUM(blocks) as blocks,
    SUM(extents) as extents
FROM dba_segments 
WHERE segment_name IN ('AUD$', 'FGA_LOG$');
```

## 10. Check Audit Trail Retention

```sql
-- Check audit trail retention settings
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_mgmt_config_params
ORDER BY audit_trail;
```

Would you like me to explain any of these queries in more detail or help you interpret the results?

### User Input

can they give sql text and bind without extended

### Planner Response

I'll update the plan to reflect our current focus on understanding the audit configuration and its capabilities.


*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

# SQL Text and Bind Variables in Standard Auditing

No, standard auditing (AUDIT_TRAIL=DB) **cannot** capture SQL text or bind variables. Here's what you need to know:

## Standard Auditing (AUDIT_TRAIL=DB)
- **Cannot** capture SQL text
- **Cannot** capture bind variables
- Only logs that an action occurred, not what data was accessed or modified

## Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA)
- **With DB_EXTENDED**: Can capture SQL text and bind variables
  ```sql
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    ...
    audit_trail => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED  -- Captures SQL text and binds
  );
  ```
- **Without DB_EXTENDED**: Only logs that an action occurred, similar to standard auditing

## What You Get with Standard Auditing
```sql
-- Example of what standard auditing captures

## If You Need SQL Text/Bind Variables
You must use FGA with DB_EXTENDED:

```sql
-- Check current audit_trail setting
SELECT name, value 
FROM v$parameter 
WHERE name = 'audit_trail';

-- To enable extended auditing (requires restart)
-- ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=DB_EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE;
-- SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
-- STARTUP;
```

Would you like me to help you check your current audit configuration or set up FGA with extended auditing?

### User Input

one lst question;DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
  ...
  audit_trail => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED  -- Captures SQL text and binds
); does not need ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail = DB, EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE; it can just work with 

ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_TRAIL=DB SCOPE=SPFILE;

### Planner Response

Let me clarify how FGA's `audit_trail` parameter works:

## FGA's `audit_trail` Parameter

The `audit_trail` parameter in `DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY` is **independent** of the database's `AUDIT_TRAIL` parameter. Here's how they work:

1. **Database-Level `AUDIT_TRAIL`**:
   ```sql
   -- This enables standard database auditing
   ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_TRAIL=DB SCOPE=SPFILE;
   ```
   - Controls standard auditing behavior
   - Requires database restart
   - Has no effect on FGA's ability to capture SQL text/binds

2. **FGA Policy `audit_trail` Parameter**:
   ```sql
   DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
     ...
     audit_trail => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED  -- This is what captures SQL text/binds
   );
   ```
   - Controls FGA-specific behavior
   - No restart needed
   - Works regardless of the database's `AUDIT_TRAIL` setting

## Key Points:

- You can capture SQL text and bind variables with FGA **without** changing the database's `AUDIT_TRAIL` parameter
- The `DB_EXTENDED` in `DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY` is what enables SQL text/bind capture
- The database's `AUDIT_TRAIL` parameter only affects standard auditing, not FGA

So to answer your question: **No, you don't need to set `AUDIT_TRAIL=DB_EXTENDED` at the database level to capture SQL text/binds with FGA.** The `DB_EXTENDED` setting in the FGA policy is sufficient.

### Planner Response

I'll help you create FGA policies for your schemas. Let's break this down into clear, manageable steps.

## Step 1: Preview the Tables to be Audited

```sql
-- First, let's see which tables we'll be working with
SELECT owner, table_name
FROM all_tables 
WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
AND ROWNUM <= 5;  -- Just show first 5 for verification
```

## Step 2: Create FGA Policies Script

```sql
-- FGA Policy Creation Script

DECLARE
  v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30);
  v_count_success NUMBER := 0;
  v_count_errors NUMBER := 0;
  v_error_message VARCHAR2(4000);
  v_sql VARCHAR2(4000);
BEGIN
  -- Process each table
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT owner, table_name 
    FROM all_tables 
    WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
    AND table_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%'
    AND ROWNUM <= 5  -- Limit to 5 tables for testing
  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      -- Create a valid policy name (max 30 chars)
      v_policy_name := 'FGA_' || 
                      SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(r.owner, '[^A-Z0-9]', ''), 1, 10) || '_' || 
                      SUBSTR(REGEXP_REPLACE(r.table_name, '[^A-Z0-9]', ''), 1, 15);
      
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------------------------------------');
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Processing: ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name);
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Policy name: ' || v_policy_name);
      
      -- Drop existing policy if it exists
      BEGIN
        v_sql := 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(''' || 
                 r.owner || ''', ''' || 
                 r.table_name || ''', ''' || 
                 v_policy_name || '''); END;';
                 
        EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Dropped existing policy');

          IF SQLCODE = -28112 THEN  -- Policy does not exist
            NULL;  -- This is fine, continue
          ELSE
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Warning dropping policy: ' || SQLERRM);
          END IF;
      END;
      
      -- Add new policy
      BEGIN
        v_sql := 'BEGIN DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(' ||
                 'object_schema   => ''' || r.owner || ''', ' ||

        EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;
        v_count_success := v_count_success + 1;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Successfully added policy');
        
      EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN
          v_count_errors := v_count_errors + 1;
          DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - ERROR adding policy: ' || SQLERRM);
          DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Error code: ' || SQLCODE);
      END;
      
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        v_count_errors := v_count_errors + 1;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - FATAL ERROR: ' || SUBSTR(SQLERRM, 1, 1000));
    END;
  END LOOP;
  
  -- Final summary
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------------------------------------');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('FGA POLICY CREATION SUMMARY');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  Successfully added: ' || v_count_success || ' policies');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  Errors:           ' || v_count_errors);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------------------------------------');
END;
/
```

## Step 3: Verify the Created Policies

```sql
-- Check what was created
SELECT 
    policy_owner,
    policy_name,
    object_owner,
    object_name,
    enabled,
    sel, ins, upd, del,
    to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as created_date
FROM 
    dba_audit_policies
WHERE 
    policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY 
    object_owner, 
    object_name;
```

## Step 4: Check FGA Audit Trail (After Some Activity)

```sql
-- Check FGA audit trail (after some DML operations)
SELECT 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
    db_user,
    os_user,
    object_schema,
    object_name, 
    policy_name,
    statement_type,
    sql_text,
    sql_bind
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1  -- Last 24 hours
    AND object_name IN (
        SELECT table_name 
        FROM all_tables 
        WHERE (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
        AND ROWNUM <= 5
    )
ORDER BY 
    timestamp DESC;
```

## Important Notes:

1. The script is set to process only 5 tables for testing (`ROWNUM <= 5`)
2. It uses `DB_EXTENDED` to capture SQL text and bind variables
3. It will automatically drop and recreate policies that already exist
4. The policy name is constructed to be unique but readable

To run this for all tables, simply remove the `AND ROWNUM <= 5` filter from the main query. Would you like me to modify any part of this script before you run it?

### User Input

see err

### Planner Response

I see you're encountering an error. Let's help you troubleshoot it. First, let's check if FGA is enabled in your database:

```sql
-- Check if FGA is enabled
SELECT value 
FROM v$option 
WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';
```

If the result is not 'TRUE', you'll need to enable FGA. Here's how to do it:

1. Connect as SYSDBA:
```sql
CONNECT / AS SYSDBA
```

2. Run the FGA installation script:
```sql
@?/rdbms/admin/catfga.sql
```

3. Verify the installation:
```sql
SELECT object_name, object_type, status 
FROM dba_objects 
WHERE object_name = 'DBMS_FGA';
```

4. Check for any compilation errors:
```sql
SELECT * FROM dba_errors 
WHERE name = 'DBMS_FGA' 
ORDER BY sequence;
```

Could you please run these commands and share the output? This will help us identify why you're getting the error.

Also, please confirm:
1. Are you connected as a user with SYSDBA privileges?
2. What is the exact error message you're seeing?
3. What version of Oracle are you using? (Run `SELECT * FROM v$version;`)

### User Input

### Planner Response

# Enabling Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA)

To enable FGA in your Oracle database, follow these steps:

## 1. Connect as SYSDBA

```sql
-- Connect as SYSDBA
CONNECT / AS SYSDBA
-- Or if you need to specify credentials:
-- CONNECT username/password@database AS SYSDBA
```

## 2. Run the FGA Installation Script

```sql
-- Run the FGA installation script
@?/rdbms/admin/catfga.sql
```

## 3. Verify the Installation

```sql
-- Check if DBMS_FGA package is valid
SELECT object_name, object_type, status 
FROM dba_objects 
WHERE object_name = 'DBMS_FGA';

-- Check for any compilation errors
SELECT * FROM dba_errors 
WHERE name = 'DBMS_FGA' 
ORDER BY sequence;

-- Verify FGA is enabled
SELECT value 
FROM v$option 
WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';
```

## 4. Grant Necessary Privileges

```sql
-- Grant FGA admin privileges to your user
GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_FGA TO your_username;
GRANT SELECT ON dba_audit_policies TO your_username;
GRANT SELECT ON dba_fga_audit_trail TO your_username;
```

## 5. Restart the Database (if required)

In some cases, you might need to restart the database for the changes to take effect:

```sql
-- Shutdown immediate
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;

-- Startup
STARTUP;
```

## 6. Verify FGA is Working

```sql
-- Create a test policy
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'SYSTEM',
    object_name     => 'DUAL',
    policy_name     => 'TEST_FGA_POLICY',
    statement_types => 'SELECT'
  );
END;
/

-- Check if policy was created
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies 
WHERE policy_name = 'TEST_FGA_POLICY';

-- Clean up test policy
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'SYSTEM',
    object_name   => 'DUAL',
    policy_name   => 'TEST_FGA_POLICY'
  );
END;
/
```

If you encounter any errors during this process, please share the exact error messages, and I'll help you troubleshoot them.

### User Input

Fine-grained access control	TRUE	0  that it mean is enabled??

### Planner Response

Yes, that's correct! The output `Fine-grained access control TRUE 0` means that Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA) is **enabled** in your Oracle database. The `TRUE` value confirms that the FGA feature is active and available for use.

You can now proceed with creating FGA policies. Here's a quick example to test if everything is working:

```sql
-- Test FGA policy creation
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'YOUR_SCHEMA',
    object_name     => 'YOUR_TABLE',
    policy_name     => 'TEST_FGA_POLICY',
    statement_types => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    enable         => TRUE,
    audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED
  );
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('FGA policy created successfully!');
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
END;
/
```

Would you like to proceed with creating FGA policies for your specific tables?

### User Input

FROM all_users 
WHERE username LIKE 'LIS%' 
   OR username LIKE 'LOV%'
   OR username LIKE 'INTG%'
ORDER BY username;

### Planner Response

Here's a more detailed query to list all tables in the specified schemas, including their sizes and row counts:

```sql
-- List all tables in LIS%, LOV%, and INTG% schemas with size information
SELECT 
    t.owner AS schema_name,
    t.table_name,
    t.tablespace_name,
    t.num_rows,
    ROUND(s.bytes/1024/1024, 2) AS size_mb,
    t.last_analyzed,
    t.status
FROM 
    all_tables t
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
         segment_name, 
         owner, 
         SUM(bytes) AS bytes 
     FROM 
         dba_segments 
     WHERE 
         segment_type = 'TABLE' 
         AND (owner LIKE 'LIS%' OR owner LIKE 'LOV%' OR owner LIKE 'INTG%')
     GROUP BY 
         segment_name, owner) s
ON 
    t.table_name = s.segment_name 
    AND t.owner = s.owner
WHERE 
    t.owner LIKE 'LIS%' 
    OR t.owner LIKE 'LOV%'
    OR t.owner LIKE 'INTG%'
ORDER BY 
    t.owner,
    t.table_name;
```

If you only need a simple list of tables, you can use this:

```sql
-- Simple list of all tables in LIS%, LOV%, and INTG% schemas
SELECT 
    owner AS schema_name,
    table_name,
    tablespace_name,
    to_char(last_analyzed, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as last_analyzed,
    status
FROM 
    all_tables
WHERE 
    owner LIKE 'LIS%' 
    OR owner LIKE 'LOV%'
    OR owner LIKE 'INTG%'
ORDER BY 
    owner,
    table_name;
```

Would you like me to modify this query further? For example, I can:
1. Add more columns
2. Filter by specific table types
3. Include only active tables
4. Add size thresholds
5. Include partitioning information

Let me know what additional details would be most helpful for your needs.

## To verify the FGA policies were created:

```sql
-- Check created policies
SELECT 
    policy_owner,
    policy_name,
    object_owner,
    object_name,
    enabled,
    sel, ins, upd, del,
    to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as created_date
FROM 
    dba_audit_policies
WHERE 
    policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY 
    object_owner, 
    object_name;
```

## To check the audit trail after some DML operations:

```sql
-- Check FGA audit trail (after some DML operations)
SELECT 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
    db_user,
    os_user,
    object_schema,
    object_name, 
    policy_name,
    statement_type,
    sql_text,
    sql_bind
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1  -- Last 24 hours
    AND object_name IN (
        'CONV_DYN_DATA',
        'CONV_GLB_FORM_DATA',
        'CONV_GLB_LOT_INFO',
        'DR_STANDARD_RSN_DESCRIPTIONS',
        'REP_REPORT_XML_LIST'
    )
ORDER BY 
    timestamp DESC;
```

This script will create FGA policies that capture all INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on the specified tables, including the SQL text and bind variables. The policies will be named in the format `FGA_<SCHEMA>_<TABLE>` (truncated to fit within 30 characters).

### Planner Response

Here's a more concise version of the script to create FGA policies for your specific tables, including SQL text and bind variables:

```sql
-- Create FGA policies for specific tables with SQL text and bind variables
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
  v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30);
  v_count NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (
    SELECT 'LIS_CONV' as owner, 'CONV_DYN_DATA' as table_name FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 'LIS_CONV', 'CONV_GLB_FORM_DATA' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 'LIS_CONV', 'CONV_GLB_LOT_INFO' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 'LIS_DR', 'DR_STANDARD_RSN_DESCRIPTIONS' FROM dual UNION ALL
    SELECT 'LIS_REP', 'REP_REPORT_XML_LIST' FROM dual
  ) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      v_policy_name := 'FGA_' || SUBSTR(r.owner, 1, 10) || '_' || SUBSTR(r.table_name, 1, 15);
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Adding policy: ' || v_policy_name || ' for ' || r.owner || '.' || r.table_name);
      
      -- Drop existing policy if it exists
      BEGIN
        DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(r.owner, r.table_name, v_policy_name);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Dropped existing policy');
      EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
      
      -- Add new policy with SQL text and bind variables
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema   => r.owner,
        object_name     => r.table_name,
        policy_name     => v_policy_name,
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        enable         => TRUE,
        audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED  -- Captures SQL text and binds
      );
      
      v_count := v_count + 1;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  - Successfully added policy');
      
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN

    END;
  END LOOP;
  
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Completed. Successfully added ' || v_count || ' policies.');
END;
/

-- Verify the created policies
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name LIKE 'FGA_%'
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

This script:
1. Creates FGA policies for your 5 specific tables
2. Captures SQL text and bind variables
3. Drops any existing policies with the same name first
4. Provides clear output of what it's doing
5. Verifies the created policies at the end

Let me know if you'd like to modify anything!

### User Input

see ..cant you try one table

### Planner Response

Here's a simple script to create an FGA policy for a single table with SQL text and bind variables:

```sql
-- Test FGA policy on a single table
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
  v_owner VARCHAR2(30) := 'LIS_CONV';
  v_table_name VARCHAR2(30) := 'CONV_DYN_DATA';
  v_policy_name VARCHAR2(30) := 'FGA_TEST_POLICY';
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Creating FGA policy on ' || v_owner || '.' || v_table_name);
  
  -- Drop existing policy if it exists
  BEGIN
    DBMS_FGA.DROP_POLICY(v_owner, v_table_name, v_policy_name);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Dropped existing policy if it existed');
  EXCEPTION 
    WHEN OTHERS THEN 
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No existing policy to drop');
  END;
  
  -- Create new policy
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => v_owner,
    object_name     => v_table_name,
    policy_name     => v_policy_name,
    statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    enable         => TRUE,
    audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED  -- Captures SQL text and binds
  );
  
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Successfully created policy: ' || v_policy_name);
  
  -- Test the policy
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Testing with a SELECT on the table...');
  FOR r IN (SELECT * FROM LIS_CONV.CONV_DYN_DATA WHERE ROWNUM <= 1) LOOP
    NULL;
  END LOOP;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Test query completed.');
  
  -- Show the audit entry
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Check audit trail with:');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SELECT * FROM dba_fga_audit_trail WHERE policy_name = ''' || v_policy_name || ''';');
  
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
END;
/

-- Verify the policy was created
SELECT owner, object_name, policy_name, enabled 
FROM dba_audit_policies
WHERE policy_name = 'FGA_TEST_POLICY';

-- Check audit trail (should be empty until DML occurs)
SELECT to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
       db_user, object_schema, object_name, policy_name,
       statement_type, sql_text
FROM dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE policy_name = 'FGA_TEST_POLICY'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

This script:
1. Creates an FGA policy on LIS_CONV.CONV_DYN_DATA
2. Captures INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
3. Includes SQL text and bind variables
4. Shows you how to verify the policy
5. Shows how to check the audit trail

After running this, perform some DML operations on the table and then check the audit trail to see the captured data.

### User Input

we did documentation for standard auditing, try to convert all these steps to fine-grained auditing - to help elimite errors;3. DB Audit Trail Configuration
1. Configuration
We need to set audit trail parameter as DB, EXTENDED to log users actions in detail.
1) Check the current value
select VALUE, DISPLAY_VALUE from v$parameter where name = 'audit_trail';
2) Change if it is not DB, EXTENDED
ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail = DB, EXTENDED SCOPE=SPFILE;
3) Restart database then check the step 1)
2. Apply audit to each private user account
1) Set Audit: there are 3 types of audit
a. Object: audit on each object (table, view, etc.), any DB user access can be logged
b. Statement/Privilege: audit on query/action types such as
SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CREATE/DROP/ALTER on DB user level
We are aiming to set the actions of some private DB user actions, so we set
Statement/Privilege Audit.
Refer to below (99. list of audit)
2) Check the audit configuration
select * from dba_obj_audit_opts; -- Object level, some configurations are set as default
SELECT * FROM DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS; -- Statement level
SELECT * FROM DBA_PRIV_AUDIT_OPTS; -- Privilege level
3. Move Tablespace only for Audit trail logs
SELECT table_name, tablespace_name FROM dba_tables WHERE table_name IN
('AUD$');
select SEGMENT_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME, BLOCKS, BYTES/1024/1024 "Size
Mb"
from dba_segments where SEGMENT_NAME in ('AUD$','FGA_LOG$');
-- Apply
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_audit_trail_location(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
audit_trail_location_value => 'USERS');
END;
/
--Check tablespace for index also uses new Tablespace
select * from dba_segments where segment_name in (
select index_name from dba_indexes where table_name = 'AUD$'
);
4. Clear Audit trail logs
By default, Audit logs are retained for 365 days but we can truncate all and manage retention
period.
Audit data is stored in AUD$ table which is using SYSTEM(or SYSAUX) tablespace,
so we need to monitor/manage the datafiles size of SYSTEM(or SYSAUX) tablespace.
1) Truncate logs
Connect as sys to truncate logs:
sqlplus "/as sysdba"
SQL>TRUNCATE TABLE sys.aud$;
SQL>TRUNCATE TABLE sys.fga_log$;
2) DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
If we have big size of audit logs of private users' actions, need consider to
manage audit logs in separate table(space) and archive it using DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
CONSIDER LATER!
3) Apply time based clear
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_mgmt_last_arch_ts;
1. Initialize
-- Apply
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.init_cleanup(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_ALL,
default_cleanup_interval => 1 /* hours */);
END;
/
--Confirm
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
BEGIN
IF
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.is_cleanup_initialized(DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAI
L_AUD_STD) THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('YES');
ELSE
DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('NO');
END IF;
END;
/
2. Configure delete records older than base time
-- Apply
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.set_last_archive_timestamp(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
last_archive_time => SYSTIMESTAMP - 1);
END;
/
--Job register
BEGIN
DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
job_name => 'SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_AUD_TIMESTAMP',
job_type => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
job_action => 'BEGIN
sys.DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(sys.DBMS_AUDI
T_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD, last_archive_time => trunc(sysdate-1,''DD''));
END;',
start_date => to_date('20240101000000','yyyymmddhh24miss'),
repeat_interval => 'freq=daily; byhour=0; byminute=0; bysecond=0;',
end_date => NULL,
enabled => TRUE,
comments => 'Update last_archive_timestamp');
END;
/
--Job views
select * from dba_jobs;
select * from dba_scheduler_jobs;
select * from DBA_SCHEDULER_JOB_RUN_DETAILS where JOB_NAME =
'SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_AUD_TIMESTAMP';
3. Manual delete
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clean_audit_trail(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD,
use_last_arch_timestamp => TRUE);
END;
/
4. Clear timestamp (if needed)
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.clear_last_archive_timestamp(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD);
END;
/
5. Deconfigure (if needed)
BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.deinit_cleanup(
audit_trail_type => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_ALL);
END;
/
5. Monitor user actions
1) DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL
We can see more detail information from the fields from DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL including
SQL_TEXT.
SELECT * FROM DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL ORDER BY EXTENDED_TIMESTAMP DESC,
SCN DESC;

# Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA) Configuration Guide

## 1. FGA Configuration

### 1.1 Check Current FGA Status
```sql
-- Check if FGA is enabled
SELECT value FROM v$option WHERE parameter = 'Fine-grained auditing';

-- Check existing FGA policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies;
```

### 1.2 Create FGA Policies

#### For Specific Tables:
```sql
-- Create FGA policy for a specific table
BEGIN
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'SCHEMA_NAME',
    object_name     => 'TABLE_NAME',
    policy_name     => 'FGA_SCHEMA_TABLE',
    statement_types => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
    enable         => TRUE,
    audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED  -- Captures SQL text and binds
  );
END;
/
```

#### For All Tables in a Schema:
```sql
-- Create FGA policies for all tables in a schema
BEGIN
  FOR t IN (SELECT table_name FROM all_tables WHERE owner = 'SCHEMA_NAME') LOOP
    BEGIN

        object_name     => t.table_name,
        policy_name     => 'FGA_' || SUBSTR('SCHEMA_NAME',1,10) || '_' || SUBSTR(t.table_name,1,15),
        statement_types => 'SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE',
        enable         => TRUE,
        audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED
      );
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added policy for SCHEMA_NAME.' || t.table_name);

    END;
  END LOOP;
END;

```

## 2. FGA Audit Trail Management

### 2.1 Move FGA Logs to Separate Tablespace
```sql
-- Create tablespace for FGA logs (if needed)
CREATE TABLESPACE fga_ts 
DATAFILE '/path/to/fga01.dbf' SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON
EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;

-- Move FGA logs to the new tablespace
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(
    audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
    audit_trail_location_value => 'FGA_TS');
END;
/
```

### 2.2 Purge FGA Logs

#### Manual Purge:
```sql
-- Purge all FGA logs
TRUNCATE TABLE sys.fga_log$;

-- Or use DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
    audit_trail_type        => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
    use_last_arch_timestamp => FALSE);
END;
/
```

#### Scheduled Purge:
```sql
-- Initialize cleanup
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.INIT_CLEANUP(
    audit_trail_type         => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
    default_cleanup_interval => 24 /* hours */);
END;
/

-- Set archive timestamp (e.g., keep 30 days)
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(
    audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
    last_archive_time    => SYSTIMESTAMP - 30,
    rac_instance_number  => NULL,
    container            => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.container_current);
END;
/

-- Create purge job
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB (
    job_name        => 'PURGE_FGA_LOGS',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN 
                          DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(
                            DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA, 
                            SYSTIMESTAMP-30);
                          DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
                            DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
                            TRUE); 
                        END;',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=0',
    enabled         => TRUE,
    comments        => 'Purge FGA logs older than 30 days');
END;
/
```

## 3. Monitor FGA Activity

```sql
-- View FGA policies
SELECT * FROM dba_audit_policies ORDER BY policy_name;

-- View FGA audit trail
SELECT 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
    db_user,
    os_user,
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    policy_name,
    statement_type,
    sql_text,
    sql_bind
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp >= SYSDATE - 1
ORDER BY 
    timestamp DESC;

-- FGA log size
SELECT 
    segment_name, 
    tablespace_name, 
    bytes/1024/1024 size_mb
FROM 
    dba_segments 
WHERE 
    segment_name = 'FGA_LOG$' 
    OR segment_name IN (
        SELECT index_name 
        FROM dba_indexes 
        WHERE table_name = 'FGA_LOG$'
    );
```

## 4. FGA Policy for DDL Operations

FGA is primarily for DML operations. For DDL auditing, use standard auditing:

```sql
-- Enable standard auditing for DDL
AUDIT ALL STATEMENTS BY ACCESS;
AUDIT ALL PRIVILEGES BY ACCESS;
AUDIT ALL BY ACCESS;
```

## 5. Important Notes

1. **Performance Impact**: FGA with SQL text capture adds overhead. Test in non-production first.
2. **Storage**: FGA logs can grow quickly. Monitor the tablespace.
3. **Privileges**: Need `EXECUTE` on `DBMS_FGA` and `SELECT` on audit views.
4. **Partitioning**: For high-volume systems, consider partitioning the FGA log table.

## 6. Example: Comprehensive FGA Setup

```sql
-- 1. Create tablespace for FGA logs
CREATE TABLESPACE fga_audit_ts 
DATAFILE '/u01/oradata/ORCL/fga_audit01.dbf' SIZE 1G 
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE 10G
EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;

-- 2. Move FGA logs to the new tablespace
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(
    audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
    audit_trail_location_value => 'FGA_AUDIT_TS');
END;
/

-- 3. Create FGA policies for critical tables
BEGIN
  -- Policy for sensitive data access
  DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema   => 'HR',
    object_name     => 'EMPLOYEES',
    policy_name     => 'FGA_HR_EMPLOYEES',
    audit_condition => 'SALARY > 10000 OR COMMISSION_PCT IS NOT NULL',
    audit_column    => 'SALARY,COMMISSION_PCT',
    handler_schema  => NULL,
    handler_module  => NULL,
    enable         => TRUE,
    statement_types => 'SELECT,UPDATE',
    audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED
  );
  
  -- Policy for all DML on sensitive tables
  FOR t IN (SELECT table_name 
            FROM all_tables 
            WHERE owner = 'FINANCE' 
            AND table_name IN ('ACCOUNTS', 'TRANSACTIONS', 'SALARY_DETAILS')) 
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY(
        object_schema   => 'FINANCE',
        object_name     => t.table_name,
        policy_name     => 'FGA_FIN_' || SUBSTR(t.table_name,1,20),
        statement_types => 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,SELECT',
        enable         => TRUE,
        audit_trail    => DBMS_FGA.DB_EXTENDED
      );
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error on FINANCE.' || t.table_name || ': ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
  END LOOP;
END;
/

-- 4. Schedule regular cleanup (keep 90 days)
BEGIN
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.INIT_CLEANUP(
    audit_trail_type         => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
    default_cleanup_interval => 24);
    
  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(
    audit_trail_type  => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
    last_archive_time => SYSTIMESTAMP - 90);
    
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB (
    job_name        => 'PURGE_FGA_LOGS',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN 
                          DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(
                            DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA, 
                            SYSTIMESTAMP-90);
                          DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
                            DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA,
                            TRUE); 
                        END;',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=2',
    enabled         => TRUE,
    comments        => 'Purge FGA logs older than 90 days');
END;
/
```

## 7. Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Check FGA log growth
SELECT 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as log_date,
    count(*) as entries,
    round(sum(nvl(vsize(sql_text),0))/1024/1024,2) as sql_text_mb,
    round(sum(nvl(vsize(sql_bind),0))/1024/1024,2) as sql_bind_mb
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp > SYSDATE - 30
GROUP BY 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
ORDER BY 
    log_date;

-- Top tables by FGA entries
SELECT 
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    count(*) as entry_count
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp > SYSDATE - 7
GROUP BY 
    object_schema, 
    object_name
ORDER BY 
    entry_count DESC;

-- Top users generating FGA entries
SELECT 
    db_user,
    os_user,
    count(*) as entry_count
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    timestamp > SYSDATE - 7
GROUP BY 
    db_user, 
    os_user
ORDER BY 
    entry_count DESC;
```

This FGA configuration provides comprehensive auditing of DML operations with SQL text and bind variables, while managing the audit trail size through scheduled purges. Adjust the retention periods and tablespaces according to your storage and compliance requirements.

### User Input

this was created LIS	CONT_ORGANIZATIONS	SYS	TEST_FGA_POLICY						YES	NO	YES	YES	YES	DB+EXTENDED	ANY_COLUMNS

### Planner Response

I see you've successfully created an FGA policy named `TEST_FGA_POLICY` on the `LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS` table. Here's what this policy is doing:

- **Policy Name**: TEST_FGA_POLICY
- **Schema**: LIS
- **Table**: CONT_ORGANIZATIONS
- **Audit Settings**:
  - **SELECT**: NO (not audited)
  - **INSERT**: YES (audited)
  - **UPDATE**: YES (audited)
  - **DELETE**: YES (audited)
- **Audit Trail**: DB+EXTENDED (captures SQL text and bind variables)

To test if it's working, try these DML operations:

```sql
-- Test INSERT
INSERT INTO LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS (org_id, org_name) 
VALUES (1, 'Test Org');

-- Test UPDATE
UPDATE LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS 
SET org_name = 'Updated Org' 
WHERE org_id = 1;

-- Test DELETE
DELETE FROM LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS 
WHERE org_id = 1;
```

Then check the audit trail:

```sql
-- View the audit entries
SELECT 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
    db_user,
    statement_type,
    sql_text,
    sql_bind
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    object_schema = 'LIS'
    AND object_name = 'CONT_ORGANIZATIONS'
ORDER BY 
    timestamp DESC;
```

Would you like to:
1. Create similar policies for other tables?
2. Modify the existing policy to include SELECT statements?
3. Add conditions to the policy (e.g., only audit certain columns or rows)?
4. See how to drop this policy if needed?

### User Input

INSERT INTO LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS
(ID, CRP_FOREIGN_COMPANY, LOG_CREATED_TS, LOG_CREATED_BY_SID, LOG_CREATED_BY, LOG_UPDATED_TS, LOG_UPDATED_BY_SID, LOG_UPDATED_BY, ORGANIZATION_TYPE, SHOW_PHISICAL_LOCATION, NAME, REGISTRATION_NUMBER, CITIZENSHIP_ID, REPRESENTATIVE_NAME, REPRESENTATIVE_DESIGNATION, REPRESENTATIVE_CONTACT_NO, IS_ARCHIVED, ARCHIVED_REMARKS)
VALUES(57576666, 0, TIMESTAMP '2020-03-25 20:45:20.313246', '6', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 6, 0, 'Hobona Ward Development Association', 'CR7274', NULL, 'GABRIEL  GLENELG  O, HOBONA', NULL, '2414125', 0, NULL); apply the above in the below;-- Test INSERT
INSERT INTO LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS (org_id, org_name) 
VALUES (1, 'Test Org');

-- Test UPDATE
UPDATE LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS 
SET org_name = 'Updated Org' 
WHERE org_id = 1;

-- Test DELETE
DELETE FROM LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS 
WHERE org_id = 1;

### Planner Response

I'll help you test the FGA policy with the provided INSERT statement. Here's how to test the FGA policy with the actual table structure:

```sql
-- Test INSERT with the provided values
INSERT INTO LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS
(ID, CRP_FOREIGN_COMPANY, LOG_CREATED_TS, LOG_CREATED_BY_SID, LOG_CREATED_BY, 
 LOG_UPDATED_TS, LOG_UPDATED_BY_SID, LOG_UPDATED_BY, ORGANIZATION_TYPE, 
 SHOW_PHISICAL_LOCATION, NAME, REGISTRATION_NUMBER, CITIZENSHIP_ID, 
 REPRESENTATIVE_NAME, REPRESENTATIVE_DESIGNATION, REPRESENTATIVE_CONTACT_NO, 
 IS_ARCHIVED, ARCHIVED_REMARKS)
VALUES(57576666, 0, TIMESTAMP '2020-03-25 20:45:20.313246', '6', NULL, 
       NULL, NULL, NULL, 6, 0, 'Hobona Ward Development Association', 
       'CR7274', NULL, 'GABRIEL  GLENELG  O, HOBONA', NULL, '2414125', 0, NULL);

-- Test UPDATE
UPDATE LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS 
SET NAME = 'Updated Organization Name',
    REPRESENTATIVE_CONTACT_NO = '2414126',
    LOG_UPDATED_TS = SYSTIMESTAMP,
    LOG_UPDATED_BY_SID = 'TEST_USER'
WHERE ID = 57576666;

-- Test DELETE
DELETE FROM LIS.CONT_ORGANIZATIONS 
WHERE ID = 57576666;

-- Check the audit trail
SELECT 
    to_char(timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as action_time,
    db_user,
    statement_type,
    sql_text,
    sql_bind,
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    policy_name
FROM 
    dba_fga_audit_trail
WHERE 
    object_schema = 'LIS'
    AND object_name = 'CONT_ORGANIZATIONS'
ORDER BY 
    timestamp DESC;
```

This will:
1. Insert a test record
2. Update the record
3. Delete the record
4. Show you all the audit entries generated by these actions

The audit trail should show all three operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) with the SQL statements and any bind variables used. The `statement_type` column will indicate which operation was performed.
